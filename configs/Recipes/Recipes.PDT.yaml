      This is the classic preparation for absinthe, which traditionally ranges from 60% to 68% alcohol by volume. The water helps release the aromatic elements of the spirit and dilutes it to a potable strength.
    glassware: absinthe glass
    ingredients:
    - 1.5 oz Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe
    - 4.5-6 oz Ice-Cold Filtered Water
    - 1	Sugar Cube
    steps:
    - Pour absinthe into a chilled absinthe glass. 
    - Place an absinthe spoon over the rim of the glass and set a sugar cube on top of the spoon. 
    - Using an absinthe fountain or water carafe, slowly pour or drip icecold water over the sugar cube into the glass. 
    - As the dripping water dissolves the sugar cube, watch the “hydrophobic” layer of undiluted absinthe rise to the top of the glass. 
    - When the mixture is completely cloudy, the drip should be ready. 
    - Stir and serve.
