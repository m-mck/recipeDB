    notes: Apricots are such a frustrating fresh fruit to work with because they’re so inconsistent. You can buy a dozen of them and have two that are perfect beyond belief, three that are almost delicious, and seven others that are a mealy bunch of nothing. That’s why I use a good apricot liqueur in this drink instead of fresh fruit. I was after a light-bodied cocktail that shone forth with fruit and nuts yet remained dry and refreshing.—JS

# Death & Co - Modern Classic Cocktails - Agave: Shaken

    author: Alex Day

    notes: Like sangria, cobblers were traditionally a means for making cheap wine better by fortifying it with a spirit and adding muddled fruit. I took the classic cobbler formula and removed most of the wine, using just a bit of sherry as a nod to the original recipe.—AD
    ingredients:
    - 1 teaspoon simple syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur
    - 2 lemon twists
    - 1 strawberry
    - 1 White sugar cube
    - 1½ ounces Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila
    - ½ ounce Jalapeño-Infused Siembra Azul Blanco Tequila
    - ½ ounce Lustau East India Solera sherry 
    - "Garnish: ½ strawberry"
    steps:
    - In a shaker, muddle the simple syrup, Maraschino liqueur, lemon twists, strawberry, and sugar cube
    - Add the tequilas and sherry and whip (shake with a few pieces of crushed ice, just until the ingredients are incorporated)
    - Dump into a double rocks glass and top with crushed ice
    - Garnish with the half strawberry and serve with a straw

    notes: I love it when one of our regulars asks us to create a cocktail on the spot based on crazy criteria—and it’s even better when we can pull off a decent drink on the first try. One night Avery Glasser, the man behind Bittermens bitters and one of the bar’s original regulars, asked me to make him a drink that contained all of his favorite ingredients. The problem was that he likes a lot of weird shit. But I gave it a shot, splitting both the base spirit and its modifiers, and it resulted in a surprisingly balanced drink.—PW

    notes: This is a concept drink that started with the name and the combination of Cynar and red wine from France’s Bergerac region. I bridged the two unlikely partners with black strap rum and Demerara syrup to create our Bergerac Mix, which has since been used in other drinks.—BF

    - 1½ ounces bergerac mix
    - 1 ounce Bols Barrel-Aged Genever
    - ½ ounce Hayman's Old Tom gin

    ingredients:
    - 3 small nectarine slices
    - 1½ ounces Lillet Blanc
    - ½ ounce Suze Saveur D’autrefois liqueur
    - ½ ounce koval rose hip liqueur

    - "Garnish: 1 mint bouquet"
    steps:
    - In a shaker, muddle the nectarine slices
    - Add the remaining ingredients and short shake with ice
    - Strain into a julep tin filled with crushed ice
    - Garnish with the mint bouquet in the center of the ice and serve with a straw

    notes: This cocktail is inspired by a vintage british drink called the treacle, which is a rum Old-Fashioned topped with a layer of apple juice. The black strap rum float in my version is almost like topping the drink with pancake syrup. First you smell the rum’s massive molasses aromas, then the acidic Pineau des Charentes, an aperitif made with grape must and cognac, cuts right through it.—TB
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Pasquet Pineau des Charentes
    - ½ ounce Cruzan Single-Barrel rum
    - ½ ounce granny smith apple juice
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce cane sugar syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Cruzan Black Strap rum
    steps:
    - Shake all the ingredients (except the black strap rum) with ice, then strain into a port glass

    notes: I wanted to build a punch around Aperol, so I paired it with a bunch of refreshing flavors, which always works with this aperitif. The combination of gin, Aperol, and grapefruit is something we use a lot. It turned out to be quite a festive punch, so I named it after sherman billingsley, an ex-bootlegger who owned New York’s famously festive stork club.—AD

    - 12 White sugar cubes
    - 8 ounces club soda
    - 6 ounces Tanqueray No. Ten gin

    notes: This is basically a big glass of vermouth, but the amaro makes it seem more complex than it is. Peach and amaro get along famously.—AD
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Dolin Dry Vermouth
    - ¾ ounce Amaro CioCiaro
    - 1 teaspoon Massenez Crème de Pêche

    - Put all the ingredients in a julep tin
    - Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice
    - Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding the tin by the rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up
    - Add more crushed ice to fill the tin two-thirds full and stir until the tin is completely frosted
    - Add more ice to form a cone above the rim

    year: 2013
    notes: This started as a spin on our house gimlet, but then it took a sharp left turn. It’s a confusing drink. Arrack is a funky, weird ingredient that a lot of people don’t like. And when you see “curry” listed in the ingredients, you think it’s going to taste like indian food. Despite having so many weird ingredients, this ended up being a surprisingly approachable cocktail.—TB
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Van Oosten Batavia-Arrack Van Oosten
    - 1 ounce Scarlet Ibis rum
    - 1 ounce Toby’s Lime Cordial

    notes: Dark, full-bodied wine is the base of our Bergerac Mix, which Brad created for his Cynaro de bergerac cocktail—and which I wanted to use again in a daiquiri-style drink (hence the name). Red wine is so complex to begin with that it’s fun to use in cocktails; the trick is to complement its flavor profile with other ingredients.—TB

    - 1 ounce Ron del Barrilito 3-Star rum

    notes: About a quarter of our guests ask us to make them something spicy. Our first reaction is always to reach for a bottle of jalapeño-infused tequila, but I wanted to try something else to expand our spicy offerings. As it turns out, red thai chiles work quite nicely with a boldly flavored rye.—JV

    - 1½ ounces Red Thai Chile-Infused Rittenhouse Rye

# Death & Co - Modern Classic Cocktails - Old-Fashioned Variations
  - name: Conference
    author: Brian Miller
    year: 2008
    notes: One of our servers asked me to make her something stirred and boozy. So I threw four of my favorite spirits into an Old-Fashioned template, splitting the base four ways. All these brown spirits needed something to tie them together. Avery glasser (of the bitters company bittermens) happened to be sitting at the bar, and he suggested trying his mole bitters. It was like lacing up a shoe.—BM
    ingredients:
    - ½ ounce Rittenhouse 100 Rye
    - ½ ounce Buffalo Trace Bourbon
    - ½ ounce calvados
    - ½ ounce Hine H Cognac
    - 1 teaspoon Demerara syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 1 dash Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters 
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon twist and 1 Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a double rocks glass over 1 large ice cube
    - Garnish with the lemon and Orange twists
