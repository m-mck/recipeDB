      Apricots are such a frustrating fresh fruit to work with because they're so inconsistent. You can buy a dozen of them and have two that are perfect beyond belief, three that are almost delicious, and seven others that are a mealy bunch of nothing. That's why I use a good apricot liqueur in this drink instead of fresh fruit. I was after a light-bodied cocktail that shone forth with fruit and nuts yet remained dry and refreshing.—JS

      This cocktail is the bastard child born out of an illicit Oaxacan love affair between the classic Last Word and the Paper Plane, a drink Sam Ross created at the West Village bar Little Branch. Choosing an aggressively smoky, funky mezcal was key here, as there is relatively little of it in the drink and it needs to stand up against two liqueurs, neither of which lacks complexity.—JS

      In this riff on the Fitty-Fitty Martini, the combination of mezcal and sherry was so drying that the cocktail needed some texture and sweetness. The smallest amount of pear liqueur and agave nectar made a huge difference.—JS

      My wife's mother is Chinese, and one of my wife's cousins married a Mexican. So I married both cultures in this cocktail—China by way of the tea and Mexico with the tequila and bitters—and named it after my wife's chinese cousin (prima being spanish for “cousin”).—JS

      I love it when one of our regulars asks us to create a cocktail on the spot based on crazy criteria—and it's even better when we can pull off a decent drink on the first try. One night Avery Glasser, the man behind Bittermens bitters and one of the bar's original regulars, asked me to make him a drink that contained all of his favorite ingredients. The problem was that he likes a lot of weird shit. But I gave it a shot, splitting both the base spirit and its modifiers, and it resulted in a surprisingly balanced drink.—PW

      It may seem odd to use Grand Marnier as a base spirit, but it's a blend of cognac and triple sec, and it can work if you balance its richness with something bitter, like Campari, and lots of citrus juice.—TW

    - ¾ ounce Grand Marnier
    - ½ ounce Bénédictine

      This cocktail is inspired by a vintage british drink called the treacle, which is a rum Old-Fashioned topped with a layer of apple juice. The black strap rum float in my version is almost like topping the drink with pancake syrup. First you smell the rum's massive molasses aromas, then the acidic Pineau des Charentes, an aperitif made with grape must and cognac, cuts right through it.—TB
    glassware: port glass
    ingredients:
    - 2 ounces Pasquet Pineau des Charentes
    - ½ ounce Cruzan Single-Barrel rum
    - ½ ounce granny smith apple juice
    - ½ ounce lemon juice
    - ¼ ounce cane sugar syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Cruzan Black Strap rum
    steps:
    - Shake all the ingredients (except the black strap rum) with ice, then strain into a port glass.
    - Float the black strap rum on top.
    - No garnish.

      I wanted to build a punch around Aperol, so I paired it with a bunch of refreshing flavors, which always works with this aperitif. The combination of gin, Aperol, and grapefruit is something we use a lot. It turned out to be quite a festive punch, so I named it after sherman billingsley, an ex-bootlegger who owned New York's famously festive stork club.—AD

    - 2 ounces Dolin Dry Vermouth

    - Put all the ingredients in a julep tin.
    - Fill the tin halfway with crushed ice.
    - Stir with a teaspoon, churning the ice as you go, for about 10 seconds, holding the tin by the rim so the entire tin can eventually frost up.

    - Add more ice to form a cone above the rim.

      This started as a spin on our house gimlet, but then it took a sharp left turn. It's a confusing drink. Arrack is a funky, weird ingredient that a lot of people don't like. And when you see “curry” listed in the ingredients, you think it's going to taste like indian food. Despite having so many weird ingredients, this ended up being a surprisingly approachable cocktail.—TB

      Dark, full-bodied wine is the base of our Bergerac Mix, which Brad created for his Cynaro de bergerac cocktail—and which I wanted to use again in a daiquiri-style drink (hence the name).

      About a quarter of our guests ask us to make them something spicy. Our first reaction is always to reach for a bottle of jalapeño-infused tequila, but I wanted to try something else to expand our spicy offerings. As it turns out, red thai chiles work quite nicely with a boldly flavored rye.—JV

      One of our servers asked me to make her something stirred and boozy. So I threw four of my favorite spirits into an Old-Fashioned template, splitting the base four ways. All these brown spirits needed something to tie them together. Avery glasser (of the bitters company bittermens) happened to be sitting at the bar, and he suggested trying his mole bitters. It was like lacing up a shoe.—BM
