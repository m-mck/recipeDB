#Flash-Blended
  - name: Tropical Itch
    notes: |+2
      Heavy flavors like mango and cinnamon glory in the additional aeration flash blending brings, making the Tropical Itch an excellent illustration of the technique. Were it shaken, the purees would remain thick but the rest of the drink would be too watery; flash blending pulls it all together. There are multiple traditions for the Tropical Itch recipe, created during the fiercely competitive bar climate at the height of tropical drinks' popularity in the mid-twentieth century. Serving tropical drinks was a big business pursued by restaurateurs worldwide, and poaching secret recipes and knowledgeable staff from competitors was the bar world's echo of the espionage underpinning the ongoing Cold War.
      
      The massive Hilton chain made a pact with Trader Vic to install his eponymous saloons in key hotel properties, while also hiring legendary bartender Joe Scialom to develop recipes for their resorts in Europe and the Caribbean. Keeping up in this arms race, Hilton nemesis Sheraton responded with a deal to bring the Kon-Tiki bar-restaurants to its thirsty lodgers. 

      Thus, a drink called the Tropical Itch was invented by Scialom, based on rum, vodka, and mango. A different drink of the same name came from Harry Yee at the Hawaiian Village Hotel (later also to come under Hilton's control) based on bourbon, rum, and passionfruit. A Kon-Tiki version was inspired by Scialom's but with gin instead of vodka. 

      In the Kon-Tiki formulation, the Tropical Itch shows that rum and gin can go together, but we felt it needed a boost to unlock the mango, which is where the pear eau-de-vie steps in (in fact, it usurped the need for gin at all). Mango and pear are often found complementing each other in herbal tea blends, a source of inspiration for the canny bartender. Eau-de-vie wasn't a common ingredient in the 1950s when the original was developed, but in every other aspect this version of the drink is classically designed. The flavor of mango is enhanced by complementing it with almond, an observation that tropical bartender Bob Esmino made to Jeff Berry (see Berry's book Sippin' Safari for further discussion) and which we have always taken to heart. The ginger in falernum further meshes with almond. This sequence of connections comes together to scratch this particular itch.

    notes: |+2
      Carbonated drinks can't be shaken, as a closed container plus agitation equals an explosive mess. But for richer flash-blended cocktails, soda water is an important lengthener. Soda water opens up a drink, lowering sweetness as it provides bubbles, allowing the ingredients' full flavor to come across in a lighter mix. It's a common technique across the menu at the Tiki-Ti, as we'll also see in drinks like the Bird of Paradise and Ray's Mystique. The Sub-Mariner is an unconventional gin and juice with the feeling of a New England-style IPA. It's designed for the exploration of the new world of nontraditional gins with unusual botanicals. Gins outside of the typical London dry style, with fruitier or spicier notes, are the right match for this recipe. Suntory's peppery Roku Gin is one interesting possibility that opens up a beautiful contrast with the fruit notes. Bimini Gin incorporates grapefruit, hops, and coriander—all perfect for tropical combinations. Another compelling choice, Monkey 47 Schwarzwald Dry Gin, is floral with inspiration from Germany's Black Forest. The level of carbonation with this process is subtle, analogous to a lightly sparkling frizzante wine. With the Sub-Mariner's heavy hit of pineapple, carbonation also conjures a thicker head of foam, amplifying the cocktail's aroma while mounting a brilliant presentation to boot.

      "The best menus do not simply list cocktails but instead categorize them by culinary objective. Cocktails arrive at the time in an evening appropriate for each: before the meal, as an amuse-bouche, or complementing (or in place of) dessert. (See the next recipe, the Banshee, for that final division.) The menus of midcentury tropical restaurants had this arrangement, often additionally assembling drinks by strength. Drinks from the “strong” category, like the Zombie or Rum Barrel, may have been more often examined in cocktail books, but those intended as smaller, lighter aperitifs offer their own pleasures. These smaller-sized drinks have become something of a lost art, with the Mai-Kai alone currently preserving the practice (with its Shark Bite and Special Reserve Daiquiri). Flash-blended aperitifs are small like an up drink, but morph over time like a rocks drink—except not very much time, as it's just a few sips until dinner. Let's consider Don's Special Daiquiri from Don the Beachcomber, with its focus on passionfruit and honey. One important aspect for its execution is the use of passionfruit puree, rather than bottled juice (sometimes labeled “nectar”). This approach was pioneered by Jeff “Beachbum” Berry and also popularized by the influential Mezcal Mule at PDT. Commercial passionfruit juice has a lot of sugar already added, along with water and citric acid—it acts more like a syrup, which limits what you can do with it. The puree is closer to cutting open a fresh piece of fruit. Passionfruit typically contains about 3 percent acid, half as tart as lemon or lime (see the section on acid adjusting, here, for more), and the puree retains this acidity, allowing us to treat passionfruit like an acid rather than a sweetener. Now there's space in the spec to fill with a different sweetener. Here it's honey, a complex ingredient on its own. Honey's high viscosity makes it hard to pour and even harder to incorporate into cocktails, so cutting it with water to make a syrup is essential. However, honey already has a fair amount of water (around 18 percent of its mass), so the amount of water that needs to be introduced to make a honey-based syrup is much lower than it would be for a sugar-based syrup. To promote honey's complexity of flavors, we favor a stronger syrup at 66 degrees Brix. If you have a refractometer (see Tools, here), you can calculate the amount of water required for the sweetness of your specific honey. Otherwise, the following recipe provides a reasonable approximation. (See the section on sugar adjusting, here, for further discussion.) As is common in the Don the Beachcomber oeuvre, the recipe exhibits a custom blend of rums to achieve a summation of characteristics not available in any one rum. The three rums here exemplify different traditionally Jamaican profiles (with the Denizen also incorporating lighter rum from Angostura in Trinidad) that work together in harmony. Special Daiquiri No. 1 is named with a number on the end, in the style of the various Daiquiri interpretations available at the Havana popularizer of that drink, the bar known as El Floridita. As for the Special Daiquiri No. 2 and beyond, that's up to you. Take advantage of the space opened up by the passionfruit puree by replacing falernum and honey with other sweeteners and substituting favorite rum blends of your own."

      "In the tropical restaurants of yore, just as you were on the verge of surrender, the waiter would once again present the cocktail menu, this time turned to its ultimate page: an enumeration of revitalizing postprandials incorporating dairy and chocolate. Donn Beach offered his Rum Cow, perhaps with an affectionate thought of New Orleans and its celebrated Brandy Milk Punch. Trader Vic built on this with the Banana Cow. After a night of quaffing rounds of drinks based on a plethora of citrus juice, it might be necessary to counter with something to settle the stomach. Today's bars have largely jettisoned the tropical dessert category. One venue that has not, largely because it has survived every drink trend since 1938, is Bryant's Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It was there that bartender-owner Bryant Sharp conceived of cocktails like the Pink Squirrel (it's pink), the Blue Tail Fly (it's blue), and the Banshee. Unlike Vic's Banana Cow, which dilutes its banana with a troubling 5 ounces of milk, the Banshee is a banana-centered sibling to dainty dairy delights like the Alexander and the Grasshopper. We've always liked it better with half-and-half instead of straight cream. But the real inspiration was ordering a Grasshopper from New Orleans bar legend Paul Gustings when he was behind the stick at Tujague's. Paul adds Cognac to create an Improved Grasshopper and it more than lives up to the name. This version of the Banshee follows Paul's pattern for the Grasshopper, with banana liqueur replacing crème de menthe and Hamilton Demerara rum replacing the Cognac. The rum is not here to brazenly assert its presence but to fortify the other ingredients. Flash blending dairy drinks confers several advantages. A bit more dilution makes the creaminess lighter and less overwhelming. The consistent chilling over the life of the drink enables you to enjoy it at a more leisurely pace; nobody wants to slam an ounce and a half of cream, and that cold, creamy drink isn't going to taste better when it warms up. Flash blending your Banshee will also create layers of texture in a manner that isn't usually found in dairy cocktails. To layer the chocolate flavors, we're using both crème de cacao and chocolate bitters. You could use any of several quality commercial bitters, but to really kick things up a notch, Dave Arnold's recipe for bitters is simple to make—and simply amazing. It will also introduce you to a powerful technique, also originated by Dave, called nitrous infusion."
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 1 dash Dave Arnold's chocolate bitters
    - 1 ounce half-and-half
    - 1 ounce banana bunch liqueur
    - ½ ounce Hamilton Demerara 86 Rum
    - 1 ounce Tempus Fugit Crème de Cacao
    - Grated nutmeg, for garnish
    steps:
    - Combine the ingredients in a mixing tin with 8 ounces of crushed ice. 
    - Flash blend for 5 seconds and pour unstrained into an Old Fashioned glass (12 ounces) with 4 ounces of crushed ice.
    - Dust with grated nutmeg. Serve with a straw.

    notes: |+2
      Los Angeles is a region known for its indistinguishable seasons. But that only applies to the weather, not to the farmers' market. This drink is an homage to winter holiday traditions amidst the Southern California climate, starting with the bright profile of a summer drink and rebuilding it for cold weather with rich notes of spice. Citrus is beautifully expressed in a simple sour, especially with added texture from an egg white. Flash blending simplifies the incorporation of egg whites. The texture of a flash-blended sour is light and velvety, as if it had been run through a nitro tap, with a head that sips like Guinness. Your rotator cuffs will thank you for avoiding the debate on all the different methods of hard shaking—let the electric mixer do the work. One important improvement to egg white drinks is the application of gum syrup instead of regular simple syrup. Acacia gum, a derivative of tree sap, gives more heft and texture to the syrup. And as acacia gum is an emulsifier, it holds the egg white better in solution. Many nineteenth-century recipes used them together, and we recommend doing so, too. (See here for more on gum syrups.) If you prefer your L.A. without smoke, swap out the mezcal for a pisco such as Macchu Pisco.

    notes: |+2
      "Fresh herbs, especially mint, are an exciting addition to a drink. But putting herbs in the drink mixer results in a ripped-up salad floating in chewy chunks throughout the glass. It's not pretty and it's not delicious. You can avoid this pitfall the way the Tiki-Ti and the Mai-Kai do: muddle the mint in the bottom of the glass first, then blend everything else and pour it on top. The drink receives the desired mint oils, but the leaves aren't agitated into expressing negative flavors, let alone their shredded remains. The original Penang Punch didn't include mint, which was a later innovation in the Mai-Kai's version, known as the Zula. The mint oil acts to dry out the drink, working in concert with the herbaceous qualities of the absinthe. Over the years, we've tried it with different combinations of rums, but we're especially pleased with this lineup. For something aged but still dry and aromatic, we looked to the English Harbour from Antigua. Barbancourt White, sometimes overlooked in favor of the company's better-known Barbancourt 5 Star, has an unusual profile with similarities both to molasses-based rum and Martinican rhum agricole. It plays well with pineapple and passionfruit. The Penang Punch, also known as the Penang Afrididi, was on the first menu at Don the Beachcomber but has been less often revived than other contemporaneous classics. The coupled crafts of muddling and flash blending makes that easy to correct."

#Shaken: Up
  - name: Daiquiri
    notes: |+2
      "The Daiquiri has been a font of inspiration for generations of tropical drinks, reaching its maturity in the hands of legendary Havana bartender Constantino Ribalaigua Vert in the 1930s. As Audrey Saunders has written, “it's one of the most fragile, challenging drinks around. It's a stark, naked drink that doesn't lie, and if you don't get it right, it's blatant at the first sip.” The Daiquiri features a delicate balance of ingredients that showcases the properties of each, and for that it has become a favorite of today's craft bartenders, for whom it acts as a yardstick for mixing ability. However, while the classic Cuban style is based on granulated sugar, when you order a Daiquiri in a craft bar, it's most likely to contain simple syrup instead, probably due to craft bars' focus on pre-Prohibition drinks that call for syrups, and the application of the same template onto the Daiquiri. Whether Daiquiris are better with granulated sugar or simple syrup is hotly debated, and the passions on both sides have yet to be quenched—even by all the Daiquiris at stake. However, as is often the case, we have an exhaustively researched opinion. Using syrup instead of granulated sugar adds extra water, which can drown out delicate flavors in the rum. Also, as the proof of most white rums available today is significantly lower than their vintage counterparts, the water content of the rum will already be higher, so lowering the amount of water in other ingredients is essential for balance. Therefore, try your Daiquiri with granulated sugar. Consider that if a sour is being made with a base spirit such as whiskey or gin, there are high-proof bottlings that can be used, like 100 proof Rittenhouse or 94.6 proof Tanqueray. Today we don't have a similarly high-proof, clean, Cuban-style rum to put into a Daiquiri, so instead of removing water from the rum, we can remove it from the syrup. One tablespoon of sugar is equivalent in sweetness to ¾ ounce of 50 Brix syrup, so our syrupless recipe still conforms to Audrey Saunders's widely adopted spec of 2 ounces of rum and ¾ ounce each of lime juice and simple syrup. An important reason bartenders prefer syrups to granulated sugar is that the standard shaking process chills the drink more quickly than the sugar can be dissolved, and the result is sugar congregating at the bottom of the glass instead of sweetening the drink as it should. Dry shaking (shaking without ice) can dissolve sugar into the drink, but that adds a cumbersome extra step to the process. Tech-savvy bartender Daniele Dalla Pola offers a neat solution: the milk frother. This coffee accessory, nothing more than a small motorized whisk, is a versatile tool, and a surprisingly brief buzz with a frother can dissolve all the sugar a drink needs. Sugar is not the only variable in a Daiquiri. There are different types of lime. There are an astonishing number of rums. And don't forget the ice. We'll remove two variables right away: lime choices are a bit constrained, as in the United States the most prominent lime is the Persian, although Key limes and, to a lesser extent, makrut limes are also on the market. (Generally, wherever you are in the world, locally available limes will work.) As for the ice, the Daiquiri is a perfect model for our strategy of one large cube and two small cubes in the shaker. Which leaves us with rum. The classic Daiquiri is made with light Cuban rum. But this presents us with two problems. First of all, as Americans, we have no access to Cuban rum. (If you believe a Daiquiri can only be made with Cuban rum, this means no bar in America has made one since the embargo began in 1962.) Secondly, today's Cuban rum is not the same as the rums that existed during the Daiquiri's heyday. Our suggestion is simple: Use whichever rum you prefer. If seeking to approximate a light Cuban, try Don Q Cristal, Angostura White Oak, or Santa Teresa Claro. There are also contemporary rums created with the Daiquiri in mind, such as Probitas, Equiano Light, Hamilton White 'Stache, and Denizen Aged White. Wray & Nephew or Rum-Bar Overproof make for deceptively quaffable variations. And there's no good reason not to use longer-aged rums or rhum agricole, although taking the Daiquiri in those directions may also be an opportunity for experimenting with other sweeteners; some suggested pairings are included in the variations that follow. The simple, beautiful Daiquiri is a world unto itself. You might explore it for the rest of your life."

    notes: |+2
      "Among the many regular customers holding up the bar at Ribalaigua's El Floridita was noted writer and drinker Ernest Hemingway. He became more than familiar with the many subtle variations on the Daiquiri that El Floridita offered. As described in the 1934 edition of El Floridita's cocktail guide, they were: No. 1 (the classic, described here, from which the others were derived), No. 2 (curaçao and orange juice), No. 3 (maraschino and grapefruit juice), and No. 4 (maraschino alone). Ingredient enhancements were not the only distinction among the drinks. They were also prepared in specialized ways, with Nos. 1 and 2 shaken and strained, No. 3 shaken and strained over shaved ice, and No. 4 ending up over shaved ice but first going through an electric blender. However, the precise approach to the No. 3 has fluctuated over the years. El Floridita's published 1934 recipe specified shaking and serving frappé (referring to the shaved ice presentation, from the French for an iced drink). But for expediency, even at El Floridita itself, the drink became frozen. Finally, in recent years, the drink has been served up, like a Daiquiri No. 1. The dilution of the drink, of course, differs with each approach to its ice. But more about that in a moment. Back to Hemingway, who took to ordering the No. 3, but without sugar, and with double the rum, in the belief that this would not exacerbate his diabetes. In the 1939 printing of El Floridita's bar manual, this variant was published as an “E. Henmiway [sic] Special.” From its big hit of booze and Hemingway's self-selected nickname, the bartenders also dubbed the drink a Papa Doble. Let's be clear: A formula with no sugar, several acids, and a bunch of rum is nowhere close to a balanced drink. We wonder if this off-menu order would be as widely known if it had been attributed to a noncelebrity. As it is, a needy customer's questionable request has made its way into the canon. But not actually in the form Hemingway quaffed it. Constantino's snowy shaved ice makes a significant impact on how the drink is perceived: The slushier consistency opens the aromatics and tames the ingredients much more than the high-acid version produced by simply straining into a coupe. Yet the latter is how it's made in craft cocktail bars today. The influential turning point may be Charles Schumann's Tropical Bar Book (1986 in German, 1989 in English), where he lists the “Ernest Hemingway Special”—exactly the Cuban ingredients, though in different proportions, but without mention of the special ice preparation. It became a shaken and strained drink like many others. From there, Dale DeGroff featured the drink at the Rainbow Room, bestowing upon it its most evocative name—the Hemingway Daiquiri. However, Dale made the crucial addition of simple syrup, analogous to the teaspoon of sugar in Constantino's original Daiquiri No. 3. This process is a bit like adapting My Fair Lady into Pygmalion, but it brought the elements back into harmony, letting the syrup do in the shaken form much of what the shaved ice achieved in the original. It's Dale's version that has propagated to the infinity of bars seeking the same high standards he employed at the Rainbow Room. As currently practiced, the drink is essentially a shaken version of the Daiquiri No. 3, with Hemingway's changes rolled back even as his memory lingers on. Our homage to Dale and Constantino follows their framework, but with the addition of citrus syrup. In the Daiquiri No. 3, sugar is dissolved into grapefruit juice; a grapefruit punch syrup simply does that in advance. (Punch syrups are discussed here) Importantly, this syrup will always be measured to the right amount of sweetness, rather than varying with every fruit. Equally important, it gets flavor from the peel, where most of citrus's character lies. In this way, we're letting lime be the sole acid, freeing grapefruit to take on the role of sweetener. While the Brugal Extra Dry isn't what would have been used historically, its crispness fits with the current perception of what this drink should be, thanks to Dale DeGroff's reconditioning of Ernest Hemingway's special call."

      Today's liquor brands engage with bartenders and consumers alike with mountains of logoed swag, a jammed calendar of sponsored cocktail competitions, and armies of celebrity consultants. In the 1960s, traditional booze marketing hadn't embraced these techniques—except for that ambitiously ahead-of-its-time liqueur, Galliano. European herbal liqueurs were in vogue in America in the 1960s, briefly squeezing their way into trendy cocktails. Drambuie found success with the Rusty Nail, a favorite of the Rat Pack, while Chartreuse tried and failed (the Swamp Water just didn't connect; for more on that see the Swamp Fire, here). Galliano hired recipe consultants to crank out Galliano-tinged variants on standard drinks like the Screwdriver (add Galliano and it's a Harvey Wallbanger, the most famed of these inventions) and the Alexander (the less-celebrated Golden Cadillac). Another such corporate creation was an expansion of the Sidecar called the Yellow Bird. Despite its fame, and its publication in cocktail manuals far and wide, its attribution is unknown; it may be the first internationally successful drink created by a cocktail consultant. The Yellow Bird, as found in Galliano brochures of the period, was classically designed, featuring ½ ounces white rum, ½ ounce Galliano, ½ ounce triple sec, and the juice of 1 lime. In the years since, the recipe has picked up extra juices such as pineapple and orange in its transformation into a “resort drink,” but it's the original Sidecar variant that deserves rediscovery. Don't be afraid of the ⅜- and ⅝-ounce measurements. On your jigger, ⅜ is halfway between ¼ and ½ ounce, and ⅝ is halfway between ½ and ¾ ounce, so the amounts are easy to eyeball. These finer gradations appear throughout the book in recipes where precise amounts of flavor make a vast difference in the result. (As an illustration of their power, according to legend, Sasha Petraske ordered custom jiggers with a ⅜-ounce marking due to his recipes' reliance on exactitude.)

      The New York Sour, a bourbon sour with a float of red wine, experienced a resurgence in New York City in the 2010s, no doubt partially thanks to the name, but more so from the focus it received in the bars of Julie Reiner. In addition to her pioneering Flatiron Lounge and Clover Club, she managed the glamorous Monkey Bar at the Hotel Elysée. “The New York Sour is mulled wine meets Whiskey Sour,” Julie told us. “People love the look of the wine slowly merging on top. Aesthetically, it's a really beautiful drink, and just as tasty. I serve it for Thanksgiving just about every year.” Our drink is a tropical remodeling of the New York Sour with a slight Scandinavian holiday flair. With the wine float a must, Krogstad Aquavit emerges as a capable pairing, as its notes of caraway and star anise imbue it with a mulled wine quality. Doubling down on this concept, the sweetener is cinnamon syrup. Trader Vic's Fog Cutter, with three base spirits and a sherry float, is the closest tropical analogue, further defining the formula. With the spices as the bass note and the aquavit singing treble, mid-tones come from a duo of aged rums. Santa Teresa provides dryness for the spices to emerge from, while Clément provides a vegetal contrast. Returning to the Fog Cutter, a drop of sherry harmonizes. Pinot Noir as the float brings a tannic element, keeping the drink dry and refreshing, while adding a deep red horizon. The Sunset Suite of the Hotel Elysée was the home of playwright Tennessee Williams for the last fifteen years of his life.

      "Over the past few years, American liquor store shelves have expanded to include rums with unusually savory profiles: bottlings like Paranubes, KoHana Koho Mahai'ula, and St. George Spirits Agua Libre. They showcase flavors such as sea salt, olive, and black garlic. Long fermentation periods replace rum's more common banana and ripe fruit notes and metamorphose it into this much brinier species of spirit. At the same time, the craft cocktail movement has embraced its savory side, experimenting with vegetal flavors where once there was only fruit. A drink that excels at this idea is the Bowery Fix, by Naren Young from Saxon and Parole in New York. A sour with layers of yellow bell pepper, Thai chile, and herbaceous Chartreuse, its savory qualities enliven the drink's mezcal and Tequila base. Similarly, at ZZ's Clam Bar, a standout on the cocktail menu was the Jalapeño, Thomas Waugh's transmutation of Jerri Banks's trailblazing Juniperotivo into a spicy Margarita. It showed how peppers and pomegranates could be formidable allies. Heroes and Villains applies these approaches to the tropical palette, like Donn Beach stalking the Hollywood Farmers Market. There's no reason that a tropical drink must only concern itself with tropical fruit stalwarts like banana, passionfruit, and coconut, when the flavors of bell pepper, cucumber, and basil can be just as compelling. There's room in the tropical family to explore it all. In this recipe, the black olive notes found within Dakabend Oaxacan Rum are matched with the bold juniper of Tanqueray, the spice notes of which are amplified by ginger and Bénédictine. Orange bell pepper brings a touch more sweetness than the yellow variety found in the Bowery Fix. Pomegranate-inspired grenadine syrup is an ingredient that has been kicking around in mixed drinks since the 1890s, but it's spent most of that time as an artificially colored sweetener with little or no fruit flavor. The craft cocktail revival's insistence on fresh juices and syrups unlocked the vibrancy of pomegranate flavor in cocktails for the first time in generations."

#Shaken: Hybrid
  - name: Mai Tai
    notes: |+2
      "If the Daiquiri is the prototype for the tropical canon, the Mai Tai is the epitome of its midcentury popularity. Unlike some of the classics we are reconsidering, it does not suffer from any defect in its conception. But it is difficult to make for another reason: entropy. When Trader Vic concocted the first Mai Tai, he used ingredients available to him. But, as ingredients are wont to do, they didn't stay available. Vic had to change the base rum several times in his restaurants' specs as old stock was depleted. The original rum in the Mai Tai was Wray & Nephew 17 Year Old, now elevated to mythic status, and which may have been manufactured on only one occasion. Its heavily flavorful Jamaican profile, so prominent in the early twentieth century, no longer held wide appeal in a world increasingly dominated by vodka. In order to give the Mai Tai more of what it lost with the disappearance of the old Wray & Nephew, Vic eventually began using two rums of complementary characters, an approach that continues to be a preferred key to the Mai Tai puzzle. (Typically, these will be a heavier-bodied Jamaican and a Martinican rhum agricole.) This illustrates a sometimes-underappreciated aspect of the craft cocktail revival, which is that you can't always make a historical recipe as it's presented in an old book. Brands of spirits don't exist or their product formulas have changed. Agricultural ingredients are different today. A contemporary bartender has to reinterpret, not just repeat. There are many possible solutions, each with its own justification. In this particular Mai Tai reinterpretation, the hybrid shake is the keystone. Like many tropical drinks made in a craft bar context, the Mai Tai is often burdened with the “snow cone” dome of ice that ultimately kills it with over-dilution. The amount of ice is both precisely measured and much reduced in our version. The lower dilution also gives greater prominence to the citrus, necessary for a proper Mai Tai profile. Changing the method of dilution is only one of the many translations needed to refurbish this standard. As we've described, proper rum substitution was a problem that even Vic had to solve more than once. In recent years, the Denizen Merchant's Reserve Rum was created specifically to fill an aromatic role in the Mai Tai, which it does admirably well. But in chasing the legendary Wray & Nephew, we wanted heavier molasses at the fore, as exemplified by Coruba. The inclusion of rhum agricole acknowledges its popularity in recipes for the Mai Tai during its first era of revival in the 1990s. Once you're using multiple rums, why not allow two orange liqueurs to harmonize as well? Grand Marnier offers a spicy bass note to the Clément's juicier treble. The 2 teaspoons of liqueurs plus ⅝ ounce of orgeat equals about 1 ounce of total sweetener, balancing the same amount of lime juice. Many people float a spent lime shell in the glass. As an improvement on the unwieldy, bobbing semi-spheres, we suggest only a wedge with its juice removed—and at the bottom, not floating on top. Its oils will then coat the ice and suffuse through the drink. New versions of this pivotal cocktail are constantly advanced and debated by bartenders worldwide. It is nigh on impossible to improve on a drink as iconic as the Mai Tai, but with its collection of small adjustments, rediscovered techniques, and precise flavor pairings, the Mai Tai you are about to make will banish all others from your heart."

    notes: |+2
      Rum is not the only tipple in the Caribbean. Especially in its English-speaking nations, Scotch holds enough sway to have fostered many local twists, such as in a highball with coconut water. (See the Romero here for a stirred take on the tradition.) Trader Vic approached from the other direction, placing bourbon whiskey at the center of a Mai Tai derivative, known as the Eastern Sour. For the opening of his restaurant in London's bustling Mayfair in 1963, he subbed Scotch and dubbed it the London Sour. Some formulations of the London Sour call for ½ or even 2 ounces of orange juice, but this drink is not a Screwdriver and doesn't shine under such conditions. Instead of dominating with orange, let it subtly combine with almond and Peychaud's cherry and anise notes to contrast the smoky and briny qualities of Scotch. For the Scotch, try the Compass Box Artist Blend, with its strong apple and vanilla culminating in a spicy finish. It's common today to finish Scotch sours with a hint of smoky Islay malt whisky, as in the influential Penicillin. Here, try the salty, savory Talisker from the Isle of Skye, which propels the almond.

  - name: Silver Lake Smash
    notes: |+2
      "The Tiki-Ti, the legendary bar on Sunset Boulevard in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, opened by Ray Buhen in 1961, has an infamously extensive menu. (Further discussion of this important bar begins here.) Among its many nuanced classics are a few hoists that are simply easy to appreciate. The Tiki-Ti offers a duo of sweet and sour combos seemingly derived from the Lemon Drop, which invaded the bar world back when ferns dominated the landscape: the Lemon Head (with a vodka base by default but also available with the vastly more flavorful Lemon Hart Demerara Rum) and the Sweet Tart (the same formula but with vanilla-inflected Whaler's Rum). We will not dwell on the fact that the Lemon Drop, Lemon Head, and Sweet Tart all are drinks whose names and raison d'être come from old-time candy. Instead, we will focus on how the drinks are constructed, and how they got that way. Jerry Thomas's How to Mix Drinks of 1862 recorded many bar practices for the first time. In the description of the Whiskey Cobbler, slices of orange are shaken in the tin along with the drink. While not muddling per se, it amounts to the same: abrading citrus peel for oil and flesh for juice. Six score years later, Dale DeGroff read these instructions and experienced an epiphany. A few pages earlier in the same tome is the Whiskey Smash, what Thomas calls “a julep on a small plan.” DeGroff had the inspiration to combine muddled lemons, in the style of the Cobbler, with the mint and sugar of the Smash, resulting in a drink he designated as a Whiskey Smash, though his formula shared only a partial lineage with that drink. Today, it's a popular offering on craft cocktail menus, often erroneously attributed fully to Thomas. In fact, the crucial part is the muddling, which was where DeGroff placed the emphasis. “I should have called it the Whiskey Smash No. 2,” Dale told us with his characteristic grin. “I never really thought Mint Juleps were so great. I mean, you're drinking water, sugar, and bourbon. Can I add a little bit of flavor? That's what this is all about.” DeGroff's transformation of the Smash is reflected in our approach to the Tiki-Ti's lemony beverage. Fresh quarters of lemon must be muddled with gum syrup to make a kind of à la minute oleosaccharum. This drink showcases citrus, both fresh lemons and preserved lime peel in lime punch syrup, but it's also a great platform for exploring the subtleties of the aged Don Q Reserva 7. The rum's character shines through the citrus in this combination, with its longer time in the barrel contrasting congenially with the drink's brighter tones."

      "Brazil's beloved Caipirinha brings together muddled limes, sugar, and cachaça, the local rendition of rum. The style is simple and elegant and invites innovations like switching base spirits or including other fruits. At the Rainbow Room, Dale DeGroff embraced the Caipirinha with gusto and helped popularize it in New York and the universe beyond. He made alluring additions like sour cherry that showed the flexibility of the form. Here is our homage to such practices. The conception is somewhere between the proto-Caipirinha referred to in Charles H. Baker Jr.'s The Gentleman's Companion as the Añejo Candido, and an off-menu request from an Existing Conditions regular for a large hit of Angostura in her Pineapple Daiquiri. This drink calls for a slightly different approach to ginger than the syrup found in our Heroes and Villains and El Diablo: namely, ginger oleosaccharum, which brings a softer, more floral ginger flavor, allowing the ginger to retreat into the wings and let the pulpiness of the lime play the starring role. (See here for a full discussion, including the oleo recipe.) Since limes are central to this drink, and limes can be especially acidic or very dry, always taste test before serving. If necessary, balance the drink with more lime or sweetener."

That extra little kick makes a big difference. Reckon you'll have to try both or be left forever wondering. In the drink's native Brazil, as well as bars worldwide, debate rages as to whether sugar or syrup should be employed—the same controversy facing the Daiquiri.

#Shaken: Collins
  - name: El Diablo
    notes: |+2
      Once relegated to obscurity, El Diablo now stands as one of the few classic cocktails that Tequila can call its own. Or can it? The recipe's origins seem straightforward. Trader Vic included a Mexican El Diablo in his Book of Food and Drink of 1946, where he noted it as one of his own formulas. It was served at both the Trader Vic's chain and his later Mexican eatery, Señor Pico. The drink's spotlighting of Tequila was innovative; the spirit was largely unknown outside of Mexico and Southern California. When the craft cocktail revival began, El Diablo was quickly embraced as first in line behind the Margarita in the small agave pantheon. The cassis brought exuberance contrasting ginger's spice and accentuating Tequila's vegetal notes. It was a nuanced easy drinker. But there are earlier sources for the drink. A now-obscure 1940 cocktail book, The How and When, published by Chicago liquor store Marco's, featured a Diablo cocktail under a section marked “Tropical Specialties.” The recipe in this book was copied verbatim from Ronrico's own marketing brochures, which date from either 1939 or 1940. Thus, the Diablo seems to have first emerged from that marketing source as a showcase of Ronrico's rum offering. The components to Vic's cocktail of 1946 are identical to the Diablo of 1940, but with a base of Tequila instead of Ronrico white rum. So why did Vic alter the Diablo's spirit base? He was, after all, a man who sold a lot of rum. But the answer may lie with another cassis and lime cocktail on the scene. The Tequila Sunrise had been the signature drink of the Agua Caliente resort in Tijuana, Mexico, since the 1920s. It looked identical to the Diablo, with soda water instead of ginger ale, though its color came from dashes of both cassis and grenadine. The resort recommended this drink to ease its norteamericano guests into the local spirit. As an incantation from their 1933 brochure has it, Tequila is “[t]he Worshiped Drink of the Aztecs . . . Wholesome . . . Pleasing . . . Forceful . . . Refreshing . . . Invigorating . . . Appetizing.” Note that this early version of the drink bears only passing resemblance to the orange juice monster the Eagles later glorified for reasons best known to themselves. Perhaps Vic contemplated these two beverages and, in his archetypical way, combined their strengths. He dropped the grenadine from the Sunrise and added the ginger ale from the Diablo, left Tequila at its heart, and El Diablo was born. In adapting this drink, our major change was to furnish an addictive spicy burn by replacing ginger ale with ginger syrup, a move common to the Sasha Petraske constellation of bars. But we've also returned to the Agua Caliente version with a touch of raspberry syrup in addition to crème de cassis. The use of more syrups in our version must be balanced by a larger amount of citrus. Lemon juice instead of lime promotes the crème de cassis and raspberry, which in turn stand up to the bolder ginger syrup. With these small innovations, the diabolical progeny of Vic, Ronrico, and the Agua Caliente can be worshipped once again.

      While Champagne drinks are not often seen in the tropical canon, they were a fixture of mixed drinks during their zenith in the nineteenth century. This was especially true of punches and cobblers, which were often served—just like later tropicals—on crushed ice. And since adding sparkling wine to a cocktail is almost always an elevation (accordingly, doing so adds “royal” to the name of a drink), here's a tropical Champagne Cobbler for your delectation. The cobbler was among the lost styles of drink rehabilitated during the craft cocktail revival, especially in the work of Dale DeGroff. (See the Silver Lake Smash, here, for a discussion.) This style of drink is spirit or wine served over “cobbled” ice, referring to its small, rounded shape (think cobblestones)—another name for crushed ice. In its classical form, the Cobbler involved prodigious citrus or berry garnishes. With DeGroff's retooling, in addition to its display as the garnish, fresh fruit is muddled as part of the drink. Our recipe takes the cobbler format and coalesces it into a famous rum drink of similar vintage, the Knickerbocker. The original plan Knickerbocker boasts raspberry syrup and aged rum, usually along with lemon or lime juice and orange curaçao, a familiar-seeming spec that presages Donn and Vic by almost a century. In our version, loganberry liqueur amplifies the qualities of the raspberry. It's a trick pulled from another Champagne drink, the great Dick Bradsell's Russian Spring Punch, which explores crèmes de cassis et framboise in tandem with freshly muddled raspberries. The loganberry, a hybrid of the North American blackberry and European raspberry, is named after amateur botanist James Harvey Logan (1841-1928), a California Superior Court judge based in Santa Cruz County.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 4 raspberries
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - ¾ ounce strained lemon juice
    - ½ ounce cane syrup
    - ½ ounce Clear Creek Loganberry Liqueur
    - 1 ounce Chairman's Reserve Rum
    - 1½ ounces dry sparkling wine (preferably Champagne)
    - Lemon wheel, for garnish
    - Raspberry, for garnish
    - Mint sprig, for garnish
    steps:
    - Muddle the raspberries at the bottom of a shaker. 
    - Add the remaining ingredients except for the sparkling wine. 
    - Shake briefly with 1 medium ice cube. 
    - Add sparkling wine to the shaker, then double strain into a chilled Collins glass (15 ounces) filled with crushed ice.
    - Garnish with a lemon wheel, raspberry, and mint.

    notes: |+2
      The Mojito is another elegantly simple creation from Cuba, a long drink with mint, lime, sugar, and rum. To maintain its elegance, use the traditional method of building the drink instead of shaking it. The challenge (as ever) is arriving at the right amount of dilution from the ice versus the soda water added to finish the cocktail. A key to nailing that balance is the enlistment of granulated sugar rather than syrup, and utilizing a milk frother to help integrate it. (See our discussion on the Daiquiri, here.) The milk frother becomes your battery-powered swizzle stick and muddler in one. It's a lighter, more delicate flash blender as much as it is a more powerful human hand. It will chill the drink without ripping the mint apart. Craft versions of the Mojito also struggle with the choice of ice. Some bars use cubed ice and serve it like a traditional Collins, while others use crushed ice and serve it like a swizzle. But for a Mojito to shine, it needs cracked ice. In this recipe, several cracked cubes are combined with a topping of crushed ice. The float of crushed ice provides a stable crown to hold the mint, while the cracked cubes keep the drink from overwatering. Try using white or organic cane sugar. The white sugar provides a cleaner finish whereas the organic cane sugar offers a touch of molasses. Don Q Cristal is a widely available rum that approximates a dry Cuban, but you may also want to try Denizen White, Barbancourt White, or Equiano Light.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 1 tablespoon organic cane sugar
    - ¾ ounce strained lime juice
    - 10 to 12 mint leaves
    - 2 ounces Don Q Cristal Rum
    - 2 ounces soda water
    - Mint sprig, for garnish
    - Lime wheel, for garnish
    steps:
    - Combine sugar, lime juice, and salt solution in a chilled Collins glass (15 ounces). 
    - Whisk with a milk frother until the sugar is fully dissolved. 
    - Add the rum and mint leaves. 
    - With the frother now powered off, use its end to muddle the leaves, lightly pressing them while moving the leaves up and down the sides of the glass.
    - Crack 5 small ice cubes with the back of a spoon and add them to the glass. 
    - Pulse blend with the milk frother until the liquid is chilled. 
    - Add soda water and top with 6 to 8 ounces of crushed ice.
    - Garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wheel.

      "At Booker and Dax, Dave Arnold confronted a problem: highballs going flat. His solution was incredibly effective and just as complicated. In a mixed drink, alcohol and bubbles are in competition. Dave's solution was to bring them together at the last possible moment before serving. He created a Rube Goldberg apparatus to facilitate this. The cocktails were batched in advance and stored in single-serving bottles kept cool in a chilled bath. When the order came in, the bottle would be carbonated à la minute via a hose connected to a CO2 canister. The freshly carbonated cocktail was then poured into an iced Collins glass along with a touch of freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice halfway through the pour. When everything came together, the result was the most effervescent and refreshing highball yet devised. But the equipment list is not for everyone. This recipe represents our downsized take on the technique. Wray & Nephew Overproof Rum and Ting grapefruit soda are two pillars of Jamaican drinking culture, separately and together. But as acquiring Ting in many parts of the world is as difficult as constructing a pressurized CO2 supply, here's an approach for home use that avoids both. When room temperature alcohol touches ice, the cubes start to weep water, leaving less room for carbonation. To avoid this, both your spirit and your glassware should come from the freezer and be as cold as possible. Frosty liquor preserves the bubbles, allowing the remaining mixers to be added halfway through building the drink. The recipe emulates the sweetness of sodas, typically 10 to 12 Brix. The special steps for this process involve only briefly stirring, and not shaking, the ingredients other than spirit and soda, then combining everything together in a glass with ice. All the dilution comes from the soda water. If possible, make your grapefruit punch syrup with white rather than pink fruit so as to more closely correspond to the Ting profile. And, if you do have Ting, leave out the juice and syrup, but build the drink as described in the rest of the spec, to make your Wray and Ting more brisk and bubbly than ever. Or replace the rum with 2 ounces of blanco Tequila from the freezer to make a delightfully chilly Paloma."

      What the Wray and Ting is to Jamaica perhaps finds an analogue with the Rum and Tonic in Barbados. It's important in sailing culture and serves as the official drink of Barbados Sailing Week. Nowadays there are an endless multitude of fancy Gin and Tonic interpretations, but not enough love is given to the rum version. Here's a delicious variation using the highball technique we've outlined, involving Tomr's Tonic syrup. (You can read more about that ingredient in the Bay of Pigs recipe.) The idea of a splash of maraschino in a Gin and Tonic was cribbed from Janet and Avery Glasser's house spec when they opened the Spanish-inspired bitters bar Amor y Amargo in New York.

#Frozen
  - name: Frozen Daiquiri
    notes: |+2
      "Part of Havana bar El Floridita's enduring reputation as “the Cradle of the Daiquiri” is undoubtedly the result of head barman Constantino Ribalaigua Vert's range of Daiquiri variations and the range of techniques exhibited to make them, with some versions shaken and some created using the then-new technology of the electric blender. Today, frozen drinks are often seen as low-brow, but they started out as an advanced culinary application. For example, in the 1962 manual International Cocktail Specialties, Madison Avenue drinks maven James Mayabb describes the frozen, shaved ice Daiquiri at the Plaza Hotel: “In the highly regarded bastion of elegance, New York's Plaza, this Society favorite is served in ‘the season.' . . . Serve in saucer champagne glass. Cut very thin wedges of fresh lime, using about 6 slices to form a ‘crown' around edge of glass. One giant strawberry in center. Serve with straws.” This lavish presentation indicates the esteem the drink was held in by “Society.” (More on strawberries gliding their way into Daiquiris in the next recipe.) The blender may not be returning to the Plaza anytime soon, but the frozen cocktail's reputation is on the mend, as evidenced by the large frozen drink machines that have been steadily creeping into the cocktail landscape. These devices freeze a cocktail uniformly, creating a sorbet-like mix suggesting a luxury version of the convenience store slushy. As they produce large batches rather than individual drinks, these machines are appropriate only for the busiest bars, so we return our attention to the original device: Can a regular blender produce cocktails as dependable and delicious as drinks from the slushy machine? Starbucks, of all entities, proves that the answer is yes, as they crank out consistently creamy frozen drinks using traditional blenders. But their advantage isn't the equipment, it's an extra ingredient: xanthan gum, a thickening agent that sometimes replaces gluten in gluten-free products. A small amount of xanthan gum makes a big difference in stabilizing frozen drinks, resisting the ice's tendency to separate to the top. We can create a top-notch slushy texture with any blender as long as we exercise care with ingredient proportions, as even small differences in the ratio of water affect how the drink freezes. In your Frozen Daiquiri, experiment with different rums. We suggest a slightly aged rum, but it also works with unaged rums, overproof, agricole, or your own blend—whichever you prefer. The Cuban Havana Club is not available in the United States, but try it if you can get it."

      "If the Frozen Daiquiri has been seen as ignoble, that goes a hundred times for the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri, which has served as the poster child for the despised era of syrupy, frigid booze bombs after the cocktail's collapse. This is tragic, as the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri used to be somebody. The celebrated Stork Club Bar Book by Lucius Beebe, published in 1946, opines that “the Stork will compound as many drinks with Cuban rums as there are days in the year” but emphasizes three “which are as dominant in their field as Martinis or Scotch and soda in theirs”—the Frozen Daiquiri, the Cuba Libre, and the MacArthur Cocktail. (We didn't know what that one was, either, but reading the provided recipe clarified that it wasn't a lost classic.) Isolated from the book's celebrity-filled pages is an appendix of drink suggestions from the Stork's staff. It is here that Edward G. Johnson, a waiter captain, endorses the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri, made with “3 or 4 ripe strawberries.” Beebe seems to be distancing himself from the drink by relegating it to the back of the book, but in fact, its availability at the bar was a draw, as evidenced by Walter Winchell's syndicated column of July 25, 1940, where the last of his verbless recommendations (two of which are about hot dogs) is: “The peach or strawberry daiquiri at the Stork.” The Ronrico distillery produced a series of bar guides in the 1940s and '50s with a wide range of cocktails, desserts, and entire meals that their rums would augment. The 1944 edition of The Rum Connoisseur immediately makes its case for the primacy of what they call the Ronrico West Indies, known outside their marketing department as a Frozen Daiquiri, in the Floridita No. 4 style. On the very next page, horizons broaden with the introduction of the “Famous Ronrico Frosted Fresh Fruit West Indies,” four Frozen Daiquiri variations embellished with the flavors of pineapple, mint, apple, and strawberry. (Ronrico also notes that, properly made, the drink in question “is a Cocktail, NOT a Sherbet.”) These 1940s references show that the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri was correctly seen as a delicacy, just as the Frozen Daiquiri itself. Its genesis was probably a bit later than the Havana heyday of Frozen Daiquiris. As Florida is a major source of strawberries, perhaps the combination originated in a Miami hotspot, where its notoriety trickled down to Miami-based Ronrico, and further into recipe brochures, newspaper columns, and history. Blending whole fruit gives the benefit of its texture, but the sugar needs to be knocked down accordingly. Contrasting the fruit flavors in our version is the boldly savory Uruapan Charanda Blanco Rum. It all balances out to something magnificent. The drink can be made year-round with strawberries from your grocer's freezer aisle. But its true luxury is conveyed only by the exhilaration of fresh strawberries at the height of their season. Be sure to mark your calendars to make the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri then, but take along one final tip: To cement the drink's frosty texture, even fresh strawberries should be frozen for at least 8 hours."

      "Chocolate and citrus are an exquisite juxtaposition beloved in confectionery but somehow underutilized in the cocktail canon. Among the few examples of such drinks are the Floridita, the 20th Century, and the Tortuga (see the Yacht Rock, here). Our approach layers several chocolate flavors: crème de cacao delivers the sweet vanilla tones often associated with chocolate, while Dave Arnold's essential bitters provide a backbone of the spicier side of chocolate, and the infused rum showcases the rich aroma of high-quality cacao. The choice of Mount Gay Black Barrel emphasizes caramelized fruit notes, which bolster the fruitiness of the nibs. Together, the ingredients heighten the contrast of chocolate and citrus, making the drink exceptionally compelling."

      In areas of the Mexican diaspora, aguas frescas are a ubiquitous refreshment that offer a palette of fruit flavors. One of the most intriguing is agua de jamaica, derived from the roselle variety of hibiscus. Even a dried hibiscus flower has an abundance of acidity, with a tartness akin to cranberry or citrus once it is infused. It's used extensively in Caribbean cuisine, where its English name is sorrel. In a classic Margarita, orange liqueur offers an additional hit of citrus. But this drink brings the acidity of hibiscus directly into an infused Tequila. With that power at the helm, an extra citrus bump is not necessary, so we're free to explore new flavors in the liqueur slot. We opted for Del Maguey Crema de Mezcal, a blend of mezcal from San Luis del Rio and miel de maguey, an unfermented syrup of roasted agave, which adds fruity notes as well as a lovely layer of smoke, enhancing the drink's agave profile.

      Mariano Martinez is a pioneer after our own detail-obsessed hearts. His East Dallas Tex-Mex restaurant, Mariano's Hacienda, served piquant and popular Margaritas, but in the high-volume heat of the moment, the quality sometimes slipped. Seeking consistent results for his customers, in 1971 Martinez devised the world's first frozen Margarita machine, adapting a soft-serve ice cream dispenser for a new, boozy career. Today that machine resides in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and its progeny have conquered the globe. To salute both the ingenuity of Mariano Martinez and the drive toward consistently delicious drinks everywhere, here's our frozen template applied to the traditional Margarita.

    notes: |+2
      Many classic cocktails have been adapted for the frozen drink machine, but attuning shaken drinks to the blender is a greater challenge due to the rush of dilution that accompanies the pulverization of ice. Drinks most amenable to blender conversion are those with ingredients that can be concentrated, which explains the use of sugar in place of syrup. Grapefruit seemed to be a flavor that would stand up to the blender process, so we looked to the quintessential grapefruit cocktail, the Salty Dog. It's served long with vodka or gin and a large measure of grapefruit juice, and is differentiated from the similar Greyhound by the presence of a salt rim, which tames the bitter edges of the grapefruit. In the classic Salty Dog, grapefruit juice brings both acidity and sweetness, but not really enough of either for balance. In order to succeed as a frozen sour, the grapefruit needed to drift toward a more fully acidic role, with sugar making up the difference. Using the technique of acid adjusting, we can focus the grapefruit juice into an acidic component akin to lime. A more acidic juice means less is needed. (Acid adjusting is explained in detail starting here.) Note that white sugar is specified; the added molasses of Demerara and organic cane sugars would obscure the grapefruit. This drink was directly inspired by the Gin and Juice served at Booker and Dax, which adapted the Greyhound/Salty Dog to its carbonated drink style. The Slushy Dog is the same idea conceived along the lines of our frozen style. The drink is a natural for brunch.

    notes: |+2
      Rupert Holmes and Warren Zevon came to regret ever mentioning them, but Piña Coladas remain frozen favorites. With a few revisions, we can lift them high above the mass-produced poolside product. The drink is about pineapple first and foremost—the clue is in the name—yet the drink is often presented with a lurch toward overwhelming creaminess. The true Piña Colada should be pineapple accented by coconut. Once you accept that, the drink makes sense. Additionally, it must be prepared as an unapologetic frozen drink; shaken versions with crushed ice are a weak reverberation. The team at Painkiller (later PKNY) understood all this, and took the fore on reestablishing this beverage. Sometimes a bartender will add lime juice to a Piña Colada in an attempt to tart up the pineapple. But, of course, it also adds the taste of lime, which is a third wheel in a drink that should showcase the flavors and textures of pineapple and coconut. Acid adjusting, which allows pineapple juice to achieve the same acidity as lime juice, is the real solution. (See here for our explanation of acid adjusting.) Adding frozen pineapple chunks provides both sweetness and texture, while the simultaneous use of pineapple juice showcases the acidic aspect of the fruit. As for the coconut component, the canned coconut cream Coco López is an excellent product. However, the addition of a small amount of coconut milk improves the texture and lowers the sweetness to the strength of standard simple syrup, while also curtailing the viscosity that can make coconut cream difficult to work with. Adding Angostura is a permutation from the mind of Dale DeGroff. It's a subtle hit of spice that works in the background. Think of how delicious a spoonful of Angostura bitters would be on a slice of fresh pineapple. We like the complexity of Scarlet Ibis punching through the richness, but a more traditional rum approach would be Don Q Gold. Or substitute a 100 proof vodka and you have yourself a Chi-Chi.

      While many classic drinks call for muddled mint, Donn Beach employed the blender to pulverize and disperse the herb in his Missionary's Downfall. Because the leaves freeze before they can brown, they lend the drink a brilliant green glow. The Cloud Forest is the Missionary by way of Booker and Dax, where a popular drink was the Thai Basil Daiquiri (or T.B.D.), which showcased an innovative nitro-muddling technique. Nitro-muddling involves rapidly freezing an herb with liquid nitrogen, then grinding it with a muddler. The result is an herb powder with fresh, strong flavors that is easily incorporated into a cocktail. Granted, the easy part comes only after the bit with giant tanks of liquid nitrogen and all the related safety gear. For those of us without such labs at home, a blender can be used to pulverize the herbs in a spirit, as the alcohol inhibits the enzyme that causes the color change. For a shaken drink like the T.B.D., the herb-liquor mix can then be transferred to a mixing tin and combined with the juice, syrup, and ice for shaking—but for the Cloud Forest we'll do the whole drink in the blender to create its distinctive frozen texture. With spicier, anise-like notes not present in sweet basil, Thai basil is a complex ingredient worth exploring in cocktails. Coconut pairs well with it (as countless curries demonstrate), so we find ourselves contemplating a Colada format. The ascorbic acid (otherwise known as vitamin C) in lime further preserves the basil color against oxidation and provides the requisite tartness. Even though it contains coconut cream, the herbaceous qualities of the drink dominate. You can think of it as an amuse-bouche or palate cleanser. The Cloud Forest also highlights judicial use of vodka in a cocktail, lengthening and fortifying a flavorful mixture without getting in its way. Any 100 proof vodka will do, but in a world of countless disappointing “craft” vodkas without much to recommend them, one product stands out to us—not for a difference in flavor, but for one in texture. Black Cow Vodka, fermented and distilled from whey left over from cheesemaking, has a subtle mouthfeel reminiscent of a milk-washed spirit straight out of the bottle. While its flavor is still neutral, allowing the Thai basil and coconut to stay central, the added texture calls to mind the chopped pineapple from the original Missionary's Downfall. The drink's name is prompted by the cloud forests of Thailand's Doi Inthanon National Park, verdant and exhilarating.

      "This chapter has detailed how blender drinks benefit from the use of granulated sugar instead of syrups. But what about drinks where syrup is irreplaceable because it is conveying a core flavor in addition to sweetness? The buck, a drink format of spirit, citrus, and ginger beer or ale, is a style where the sweetness comes wrapped in flavor. Making your own ginger syrup affords much more control than commercially produced ginger beers, but there is still the challenge of integrating it into a frozen drink without over-dilution. The way a frozen drink machine works suggests how it could be done, even without such a machine. The slushy machine slowly and uniformly freezes a mixture, then keeps it circulating to stay that way. We can replicate those steps with two appliances you already have: the freezer and the blender. The same results produced by a slushy machine can be achieved by batching the cocktail with water and sealing it in an airtight container in the freezer. The slow, uniform freezing process yields a different ice crystal structure than what's found in a regular blender drink. Moreover, ice doesn't need to be added later—the drink becomes its own ice. When the mixture is suitably frozen, the blender can then perform the circulation needed to create the drink's uniformity. Only a short blend is required, as the drink is already frozen (and remember, longer blending will melt it). It should take about 3 to 5 seconds of blending for the mixture to resemble a slushy drink. Lime juice is added fresh to ensure a crucial citrus bite. Since it doesn't contain fruit juice, the batch can slumber in the freezer until you're ready to serve. The rum blend for this drink is Coruba for body and Black Barrel for aromatics, with the two forming a strong base for the spice component. You can also try the same formula with gin, whiskey, or vodka. The following specification can be scaled up to four servings for easier blending. In a pinch, you can also shake the frozen mixture in a tin, which will break it up into drinkable consistency."

#Ice Molds and Shaved Ice
  - name: Manta Ray
    notes: |+2
      "One of the most alluring of a host of alluring beverages available at the Mai-Kai is the Moonkist Coconut, offering more dimensions of spicy and savory notes than the typical coconut drink. While the Mai-Kai is famously secretive about its methods, the Moonkist Coconut was described in a 1959 Esquire profile of the bar, making it one of the few Mai-Kai recipes to be officially declassified. A full, historical spec to work from was a rare opportunity. After close study, we present the Manta Ray, which follows its progenitor's lofty ambitions. As the Mai-Kai's offerings are based on the Don the Beachcomber canon, the Manta Ray is a careful pastiche of some of Donn's greatest hits: honey and ginger, as in the Queen's Road, plus peach and mint from the Missionary's Downfall. Rum and gin are paired in some of the canon's favorites, such as the Fog Cutter and Ray's Mistake (we discuss these in our recipes for the Scarlet Fog, here, and Ray's Mystique, here). Finding the right combination requires some calculation, as every rum has its own flavor notes just as gins have their botanical profiles. We found a happy match between Fords and Barbancourt. Fords's jasmine elements work well with the peach and coconut while its citrus notes suit the lime and mint. Barbancourt's full flavor rounds out the drink. The muddling technique here is the same as in the Penang Punch."

      Whiskey doesn't figure into many tropical drinks, so it's easy to get trapped in the framework of those drinks where it does appear, such as the Starboard Light and the Port Light. Like a number of Trader Vic drinks, they're tropical Whiskey Sours, easy to appreciate and easy to tinker with. Here's another crack at the template where each ingredient suggests the next. Cherry and apple go well together; apple and whiskey go well together. And one of the most rapidly growing markets for Scotch is Southeast Asia, where makrut lime leaves receive many culinary applications. These overlapping observations suggested the elements of a new recipe. Cherry-inflected red fassionola syrup is the start. Tartness comes from Granny Smith apple juice. The herbal flavors of lime leaf exhibit the freshness of the apples, joining their malic acid forces. It all sits on that bed of Scotch, which can stand up to these aggressive flavors. As makrut lime leaves are both hard to come by and not long lasting, a nitrous-infused tincture technique preserves their attributes for as long as possible. The same technique works with other herbs, too. (See the Banshee for a discussion of nitrous infusion.) Try the lime leaf tincture in a Gin and Tonic, a Daiquiri, or drinks with coconut. Maria Ann Sherwood “Granny” Smith was a nineteenth-century Anglo-Australian midwife and orchardist, whose property in New South Wales abutted public land known as the Field of Mars. This term refers to a parade ground used by the military, but it nicely evokes our crimson-hued beverage and its space-age ice cone.

  - name: Colonial Grog
    notes: |+2
      This Don the Beachcomber recipe from 1944 was unearthed by Jeff “Beachbum” Berry in the private papers of Mariano Licudine, the Beachcomber bartender who would later achieve fame as the drinks developer at the Mai-Kai. (On the Mai-Kai's menu, the Colonial Grog appears in disguise as the Samoan Grog.) Maple syrup makes a rare appearance in a tropical drink, but fits in admirably here. The average maple syrup clocks in at about 66 Brix, in the range of a cane syrup, but with a darker, woodier pungency. “It's just such a good example of how Donn Beach was constantly pushing himself to find and fold new ingredients into old templates,” Jeff told us. “Using maple syrup as the sweetener instantly sets the Colonial Grog apart from all of Donn's many other Planter's Punch variations, and shows how a little imagination can go a long way in drink assemblage.” With this recipe Donn turned from his usual South Pacific themes to romanticize the colonial period of New England; the drink was sometimes described on his menus as involving “Very Old New England Rum.” Such rum was still produced into the 1970s and has undergone a resurgence today, but for this version we're going even deeper into American drinking history. Maple syrup and molasses were staples of colonial taverns—alongside rum, the spirit of choice in America's early days. Port, Madeira, sherry, and other imported fortified wines were also important in the period, so our version incorporates that colonial compulsion as well, by way of two cask-finished rums of unusual provenance. Dos Maderas PX 5+5 is a blended rum sourced from Barbados and Guyana, aged for five years in the Caribbean in American oak and finished for an additional five years in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks in Spain. The Navazos Palazzi Oloroso Cask rum takes a molasses-based rum of an unspecified Caribbean origin and ages it for ten years in used Oloroso sherry casks. The Dos Maderas offers a wetter sherry flavor while the Navazos Palazzi is dry and woody. If the Navazos is not readily available, try English Harbour 5 Year Old Rum from Antigua. Finishing the wine profile, Noilly Prat Extra Dry Vermouth brings acidity and crispness. The layering of these wine flavors is in line with both Donn's intentions and the cravings of the colonials.

#Expansion
#Old Fashioned
  - name: Romero
    notes: |+2
      "The Romero is built like a late nineteenth-century Improved Whiskey Cocktail, which took the Old Fashioned pattern and added more layers of flavor through liqueurs. Here the liqueurs will be tropical. Trader Vic's menus indicated “a whisper of almond” in his canonical Mai Tai and Scorpion Bowl, as he assigned the nut to an ongoing central role in tropical drinks. In the realm of stirred cocktails, almonds play a part in simple drinks like the Godfather, a basic combo of blended Scotch and Amaretto. It did for Disaronno what the Rusty Nail did for Drambuie: move a lot of product in 1970s fern bars. The two-ingredient Godfather is close to an Old Fashioned, and serves as the starting point for this tropical Scotch exercise. While pairing Scotch with Amaretto was natural enough in the States, teaming Scotch with coconut water is a common Caribbean refresher. The Romero makes a unified Old Fashioned out of both Scotch combinations. Instead of almond, we'll engage walnut. It pairs well with earthy flavors, so our Scotch is Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie, an unpeated Islay malt with an especially grain-forward profile. It will be the fire on which we roast the walnuts. However, if you prefer your walnuts more heavily roasted, split the Classic Laddie with a smokier Scotch such as Talisker or Bruichladdich's Port Charlotte. Horror film director George A. Romero is, of course, the “Godfather of the Dead.” Perhaps the aroma of this drink will conjure candy bars at a drive-in double feature. (For some reason, we're thinking we might mix a Zombie next.)"

      The bitters that you dash into your Old Fashioned are referred to as nonpotable bitters, since their highly concentrated bitterness makes them suitable only as an accent rather than the main beverage. But replacing them with a bitter spirit designed to be enjoyed on its own, like an Italian amaro, opens up a vast new stretch of Old Fashioned possibility. A particularly popular category of amaro is fernet, a bitter liqueur strongly flavored with a blend of herbs, which vary from brand to brand. When we say popular, we mean especially with bartenders—witness the hearty revival of fernet-forward drinks like the Toronto or Hanky Panky. Prime Meats in Brooklyn was known for a range of bitter cocktails, developed by head bartender Damon Boelte, that incorporated the leading fernet brand Fernet-Branca. While sampling one, a guest from Amsterdam revealed that back home he liked to drink fernet with violet syrup. It seemed like a discordant match, as both ingredients could dominate a drink on their own. How could dual dictators learn to peacefully rule the same land? The trick was finding the right fernet. Luxardo's version is a bit drier than Branca, and contains savory notes, like cardamom, that harmonize with crème de violette. To arrange the drink in an Old Fashioned mold, it needed a base spirit strong enough to stand up to these two powerhouses. The vegetal, high-proof Rhum J.M is equal to the task. Black pepper as the garnish was suggested by Jim Kearns when this drink was served at Slowly Shirley. It intensifies the arugula-like spiciness of the Luxardo Fernet and J.M Blanc combination. This drink is served up, bringing its template closer to the Whiskey Cocktail than the Old Fashioned, though the serve is their major distinction. In its up form, the aromatics of the rum and amaro are better perceived. The black pepper becomes more intense as the drink warms. Violet Chachki is a renowned drag queen, burlesque artist, and aerialist who shares fashion and mystery with this cocktail.

  - name: Bay of Pigs
    notes: |+2
      The Bay of Pigs is a drink that transforms the Cuba Libre into an Old Fashioned, much as the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion was meant to do with the real Cuba. The Cuba Libre, known to capitalists as a rum and Coca-Cola with lime, is a classic highball, but as Coke is only a couple of steps from being a kind of nonalcoholic amaro, we thought it could be telescoped into the Old Fashioned format. The Filmograph cocktail, outlined in Ted Haigh's Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, and consisting of brandy, lemon syrup, and kola tonic, was the initial impetus for this drink. West Africa's kola nut is the basis for kola tonic, but, of course, it's also the second half of the famous name of Coca-Cola. Like cocaine, kola nut is no longer a component of Coca-Cola, which now uses artificial flavors to get somewhere in the vicinity. Instead of kola tonic, we'll turn sugarcane-based Mexican Coke into a syrup, which we call a “grog concentrate” from similar flavors in Trader Vic's version of the Navy Grog. (See here for the tale.) The tonic component comes courtesy of inventive bartender Tom Richter's Tomr's Tonic syrup. Tom developed the ingredient to bring natural cinchona bark back to the Gin and Tonic, which had long languished among high-fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors. His syrup is meant to be added to club soda to create tonic water, but here we're using it in concentrated form. (You can find it sold online, including from Tom's own site. See here for its application in the Rum and Tonic.) The cordial and concentrates bring acidity, which isn't traditionally part of an Old Fashioned, but helps to replicate the bite of the bubbles in a Cuba Libre, here absent. The acidity differentiates the Bay of Pigs from other Old Fashioneds, just as lime transforms a rum and Coke into a Cuba Libre. The clarified cordial makes this possible, as we'll see in other stirred drinks such as the Beachcomber Negroni, Classic Gimlet, and Improved Rum Cocktail. To get a bit closer to the characteristics of the aged Cuban rums of yore, we're calling for a blend of Don Q Cristal, which replicates the lightness of a traditional Cuban, and Chairman's Reserve, which despite not being in the Cuban tradition brings more of the molasses-forward qualities that would have been found in an early twentieth-century Cuban rum. A traditional Old Fashioned is stirred in the glass with a big rock of ice. For the Bay of Pigs, we indicate stirring in a mixing glass with cubed ice before serving over the usual big rock because, unlike the traditional Old Fashioned, the Bay of Pigs contains a much higher level of acid, which must be balanced by more dilution to prevent its dominance.

#Martini & Manhattan
  - name: El Presidente
    notes: |+2
      As ever, Cuba is the font of libationary imagination. This truly tropical stirred drink arose on its shores sometime around 1915, when it first appeared in print in John B. Escalante's Manual de Cantinero. While often mistaken for a rum Martini in the years since, the original drink holds more mystery. “Upside down” or “inverted” variants of cocktails, where a low-proof ingredient (for example, vermouth) is used in greater measure than a high-proof one (for instance, rum), are popular with both bartenders and bar-goers today, offering an experience that's lower in alcohol but still rich with flavor—and especially aroma. “Aroma molecules are . . . more chemically similar to alcohol molecules than they are to water, so they tend to cling to alcohol, and are quicker to evaporate out of a drink when there's less alcohol to cling to,” Harold McGee wrote in a 2010 New York Times piece. “This means that the more alcoholic a drink is, the more it cloisters its aroma molecules, and the less aroma it releases into the air. Add water and there's less alcohol to irritate and burn, and more aroma release.” The original El Presidente from 1915 was there first, specifying two parts of vermouth to one of rum. The Cuban original called for vermouth de Chambéry, a specific style from the Alpine outpost of Chambéry with a distinct flavor profile that was long missing from the American market. We're fortunate that there are now two such vermouths available, Dolin Blanc and Comoz Blanc Vermouth de Chambéry. The restitution of this ingredient makes a huge difference in the drink's success. Dolin suggests elderflower, vanilla, plenty of citrus, and a thin thread of bitterness from wormwood. Comoz proceeds in a similar vein, but with a stronger wormwood note, and a finish of stone fruit and cherries. In El Presidente, the attributes of the Comoz mesh with the other ingredients in a manner tailor-made. For the rums, Hamilton is dry but aromatic, working to support the vermouth, while Scarlet Ibis brings a bit of gravitas. As with other inverted drinks—and like the Martini—El Presidente has evolved over the years to accommodate changing tastes. While the original was “upside down” and modern takes are usually rum-forward, in truth the vermouth to spirit ratio exists on a sliding scale. Audrey Saunders's Pegu Club was a haven for inverted drinks as well as her revitalization of the equal parts Martini (known with New York swagger as a Fiddy-Fiddy). Our Presidente takes this equitable approach, but can be easily adjusted to any ratio you prefer.

      This riff puts quinine-flavored fortified wine in place of the vermouth, and makes it the main ingredient, as in the original 1915 El Presidente. The Byrrh, with a base of red mistelle, presents a fascinating fruit contrast to the rum in a totally different way from the vermouth version. Barbancourt's dryness is akin to an aged Cuban rum, but its fresh cane backbone correlates with the vegetal sting of quinine in the Byrrh. Orgeat replaces grenadine to add a floral finish. Our friend Charles H. Baker Jr. was a loyal fan of the theatrical channeled lime twist garnish, even when not entirely justified. Here its purposeful existence imbues the drink with brightness, like the ghost of fruit the cocktail does not contain.

    notes: |+2
      Among the onslaught of Galliano cocktails during the 1960s and 1970s (see the Yellow Bird, here, for more), the Raffaello stands out. This drink by Angelo Zola, the long-tenured president of the International Bartenders Association, combines pisco and blanc vermouth, an unusual choice for the period. It seems more like a cocktail you'd find at a craft bar today. Although containing vermouth and no juice, the Raffaello was specified as being shaken and served over ice. The Golden Horseshoe is a reimagination of that spec as the stirred, up drink it yearns to be. Vanilla and a complex composite of botanicals are at the foundation of both blanc vermouth and Galliano. The Golden Horseshoe is engineered like a classically layered tropical drink, and every layer reinforces that Galliano and blanc vermouth duet. Contratto Bianco vermouth is both bitter and juicy, with a strong note of chamomile, another traditional pairing with vanilla, which also finds resonance in the Bittermens Boston Bittahs. Replacing pisco is a Highland Tequila with savory characteristics and salinity, plus the black pepper power of Spanish Mahón gin—a salt and pepper sonority among the many botanicals. To balance these conspicuous savory qualities, a liqueur complementary to Galliano was needed. Thyme liqueur, an underrated bartender's tool, works alongside Galliano's lavender aspect just as the two herbs drive many contemporary interpretations of herbes de Provence.

      The Algonquin is a drink with an enigmatic past and an unusual recipe that weaves rye, vermouth, Angostura, and pineapple. Its favor during the cocktail revival may have more to do with its narrative than its composition. It's time to admit that it isn't a great drink. To the ears of many cocktailians, the name Algonquin conjures up the wit, bonhomie, and alcohol enthusiasm of the literary members of the Algonquin Round Table, who lunched for years at the eponymous New York hotel. While it is not entirely evident that the drink is named after the hotel, that's what we all want to believe. From the end of Prohibition in 1933 until his untimely death in 1941, G. Selmer Fougner wrote an incomparable newspaper column, “Along the Wine Trail,” a daily feature of the New York Sun. In addition to bringing his readership up to speed on a few thousand years of wine and food history (of which Americans were only beginning to become aware), he regularly fielded questions from imbibers seeking the recipe to a cocktail they'd encountered in the wild. Therefore, his column is often the earliest printed source for recipes, and so it is with the rye and pineapple Algonquin. Fougner's April 14, 1934, column responds to the reader query, “Are the Manhattan and the Old Fashioned the only good cocktails which may be made with rye whisky?” with a curation of six recommendations, including the “New Algonquin.” From there the drink was collected in numerous other cocktail guides including the influential Fine Art of Mixing Drinks by David Embury, from whence it has been rediscovered by today's bartenders. Yet, it remains a disconcerting combination not befitting the august Algonquin name. Pineapple juice brings sweetness, but it also brings a lot of dilution, as does the dry vermouth, and the rye is not strong enough to counter them. Instead, it ends up losing its spicy edge in the deluge. Let's apply our principles to resuscitate the concept. Instead of remaining locked up in juice, pineapple flavor can be concentrated directly into the rye through infusion. With the volume of the juice removed, the whiskey and vermouth are free to relate to one another as they would in a typical Manhattan. But the recipe needs one final nudge. In another rye and dry vermouth stirred drink, the Brooklyn, amaro and maraschino play a part. Here they replace the bitters. Hoy Wong worked as a bartender for fifty-eight years, the final thirty of which were spent at the Algonquin Hotel, before his retirement in 2009 at eighty-eight years of age. He was the oldest working barman in New York, known to all as Mr. Hoy. We will close this discussion with a story from the career of Hoy Wong that has often been told, but not always fully annotated. In 1961, Mr. Hoy was working the bar at celebrity hangout Freeman Chum's when the Duke of Windsor (formerly known as King Edward VIII) stepped up and called for “a House of Lords Martini in and out on toast.” Mr. Hoy calmly and immediately made the drink exactly as the Duke expected, and the royal personage went away satisfied. But what the heck was that order, with its ducal spin on soda jerk slang? “House of Lords” is the brand of gin, “in and out” is the practice of swirling vermouth in the glass and then discarding it, and “on toast” is a flamed lemon twist. Here, the skill on display does not involve the drink's execution as much as it does Mr. Hoy's ability to manifest even the most abstruse desires of his guests. We leave this as an exercise for the reader.

#Negroni
  - name: De Ville
    notes: |+2
      The Quill cocktail—a Negroni with its botanicals supercharged with a dash of absinthe—struck us as a drink ripe for co-option into the tropical canon. Donn's “rhum rhapsodies” made regular use of absinthe, although usually in greater quantities than classic cocktails did. Perhaps the subtle Quill could form a bridge into a new tropical aperitif format. Two relatively recent expressions from Martini & Rossi, an intense amber vermouth and a spicy bitter, slotted into the sweet vermouth and Campari roles. The Martini bitter, with a higher presence of angostura bark than most red bitters, interacts with the absinthe similarly to the one-two punch of Angostura bitters and absinthe found in Donn's drinks. For the absinthe, Vieux Pontarlier, brighter and higher in proof than our other commonly used brand, St. George, seemed the right fit, offering lively citrus and fennel notes. Rounding it out, we chose a split base of rums with enough age and aromatics to hold their own against the absinthe. Over many years of manufacture, Cadillac rendered the name of its famous car with various combinations of capitalization and spacing (“de Ville,” “De Ville,” “deVille,” and “DeVille”). In 1967, the spelling of the moment was “De Ville,” and paint options included two arresting ruby shades, Flamenco Red and Ember Firemist. Our cocktail lands somewhere in between.

      The last few years have brought an explosion of new liqueur brands and flavors to the market, which has been a boon to creating new recipes and innovating on classics. However, one commercially available ingredient that has yet to match our needs is banana liqueur. The new offerings come off as a bit green and bitter. They do not conjure the canonical experience of bananas for breakfast, proudly topping French toast. While the longtime stalwart, 99 Bananas, tastes strongly of artificially flavored candy, its high proof does deliver that flavor well. Artificial banana flavor was designed to mimic the now-defunct Gros Michel cultivar, which was the dominant type of banana until disease hit the global industry in the 1950s. The current top banana, the Cavendish (which now has its own difficulties with disease), is generally considered to be less delectable than the Gros Michel. This is due to far lower levels of an ester known as isoamyl acetate, which happens to be the main ingredient in artificial banana flavor. This is a roundabout way of saying that artificial banana flavor actually tastes more like bananas than bananas do anymore. Why not capture the best of both worlds by infusing 99 Bananas with real bananas? Freeze-dried banana slices, which are widely available, yield a better result than dehydrated or even fresh, as this process best preserves the fruit's delicate aromas. The bananas rehydrate in whatever liquid they are steeped in, resulting, in this case, in an amazing, layered banana flavor that spans the ages of Gros Michel and Cavendish. With the stacking of one banana atop another, we create our banana bunch liqueur, for which the recipe is included here. Mezcal can walk the line between fruity, saline, and acidic in a way that shows off the banana's special qualities. Del Maguey Chichicapa or Vida mesh well here. The dry vermouth accent was suggested by Don the Beachcomber's Tahitian Punch, an interesting application of banana and white wine.

      "Donn Beach organized the bottles in his bar with two goals in mind: to assist his bartenders in making his drinks and to confound attempts by his competitors' bartenders to make them. Many recipes were executed by his team without ever knowing what was truly in bottles labeled only with code names. Most such entities were blandly numbered, but one was proudly labeled Don's Mix. If the name wasn't intriguing enough, the mix featured in one of Donn's most beloved creations, the original 1934 version of the Zombie. When Donn seemingly took the Mix's recipe to his grave, tropical cocktailians were mourning more than just the great man's passing. As with just about every other question arising from long-lost tropical recipes, it was Jeff “Beachbum” Berry who cracked the case. (Read his page-turning account of gumshoeing all the way to Donn's secrets in Sippin' Safari.) The sought-after key was revealed to be one part cinnamon syrup to two parts grapefruit juice. It unlocked the classic Zombie for the first time in decades. But it was also a bit of prosaic bar bureaucracy. Other than to purposely confuse rivals, was there a reason to keep grapefruit juice and cinnamon syrup together? Ubiquitous deployment wasn't the case—the Donga Punch was the only other drink to use it—and plenty of drinks used cinnamon or grapefruit separately, so Donn was increasing rather than decreasing the bottles in his well. The shelf life of those bottles also shortened because juice degrades faster than syrup. Nevertheless, the “rhum rhapsody” tradition was built on unusual flavor combinations as exemplified by ingredients like Don's Mix. Was there a way to evolve the mix to where it could be used more widely in drinks, where it conveyed its flavors more directly? Could we make a cordial that infuses the cinnamon directly into the grapefruit juice, thus cutting down on the increased water content? Using clarified juice solves the shelf life discrepancy. Incorporating grapefruit peel raises the mixture to a pungency not found in mere juice. We have a bolder Don's Mix, with more flavor and less water, to unleash on stirred drinks in precise amounts. It's built as a spiced cordial, in line with the cordial techniques covered here. Reflecting its changed status, it's now Don's Remix. That takes care of the Mix, now how about the drink itself? Campari works as well with grapefruit as it does with its more common partner, orange, so a Negroni format seemed the right place to start. The Beachcomber Negroni follows a dry vermouth Negroni template, as in variants like the Cardinale or Lucien Gaudin, but with reduced Campari augmented with a small amount of fruit from Don's Remix and clarified lime juice. This hint of acidity gives the feel of squeezing a lime into a Wray and Ting or dropping one into a Ti' Punch. Here, the lime is invisible but its presence is clear. The combination of rums follows Donn's trendsetting approach of blending rums of different characteristics, but with unaged and lightly aged spirits, which he rarely used. Flor de Caña contributes creaminess, Banks offers aromatics, and Wray & Nephew bestows raw power. Unlike a standard Negroni that is built in the glass, this drink is stirred with ice and strained, as the higher acid needs a bit more water to balance."

      Chartreuse has been an outsized player in the craft cocktail revival, but in the mid-1970s it was a little-known French liqueur struggling to find a home in the juice-filled highballs dominating the nightclub scene. Chartreuse's importer, Schieffelin & Co., took note when rival importer McKesson used signature cocktails to drum up massive demand for their own brightly colored European import, Galliano. The Yellow Bird and the Raffaello, reimagined here as the Golden Horseshoe, poured the canary-colored liqueur into the public consciousness, and Schieffelin set out to find an equally captivating platform for their monastically produced herbal liqueur among the Harvey Wallbangers and Tequila Sunrises. The resulting drink was the Swamp Water, a shot of Green Chartreuse topped with pineapple juice and a squeeze of lime—a savvy combination that played into the liqueur's natural affinity with pineapple to make for easy sipping without losing herbal nuance. Schieffelin pulled out the stops on advertising, plastering a cartoon alligator across custom glassware and print ads that promised “more bang than a Wallbanger, more fire than a Sunrise.” Alas, even cocktail-sippin' gators couldn't convince nightclubbers that this was true party fuel, and the Swamp Water sank out of sight. Our version, the Swamp Fire, brings plenty of bang and fire, at long last fulfilling the advertised promise. Augmenting the Chartreuse and pineapple combo are jalapeño-infused Tequila and green chile vodka, for the feeling of both hot and sweet peppers. As the St. George Green Chile Vodka also involves lime peel and cilantro, these are echoed in the other ingredients. The drink exhibits a pepper flavor that's both broad and deep. The structure of this drink has similarities to the Blue Leilani, though you wouldn't know it from the flavor or appearance.

      You like olives in your Martini; how about some olive oil in your Daiquiri? A new, salty flavor profile for rum has erupted on the scene, with several Mexican rums with long fermentation periods offering intensely briny qualities. They offer notes of olives, grilled corn, and even herbs. We wanted to construct a sour that would match the intricacies of these rums. The now-shuttered Marvel Bar in Minneapolis was known for its juggling of classical and innovative techniques, as exemplified by its Oliveto cocktail. The bar wizards at Marvel determined that Italian olive oil cake would be a good starting point for a cocktail, and wisely realized that egg white in the drink would emulsify the olive oil, preventing it from separating while conveying a complex texture. While the Oliveto proves its point as a sweet drink, our Minoan takes a salty route. Among the briny Mexican rums, Paranubes is aggressively olive-forward. The beast is tamed with Manzanilla sherry, embodying the contemplation of an ocean breeze. Citrus comes from lime juice and lime punch syrup, with the oily texture of the syrup dovetailing into the lush merger of olive oil and egg white. Choose a flavorful extra virgin olive oil, as its taste, not just its texture, will come out in the drink. Instead of salt solution, this drink is finished with olive brine, which is just flavored salt water. The same flash-blended egg technique from Winter in L.A. is used here. It would be quite a chore to shake, but the flash blender makes it effortless and highly aerated. The ancient Minoan civilization was an early producer of olive oil, using it not just for food, but as a cleanser, in tanning hides, and as fuel. They missed the cocktail connection, though.

      "The Li Po Cocktail Lounge is a veteran of the San Francisco bar scene (it's been in operation since 1937, the same year as the opening of the city's well-regarded bridge to Marin County). Named for a Tang dynasty poet known for seeking the muse through drink, Li Po's signature cocktail is the Chinese Mai Tai, a spicy spin on the Hawaiian style with a hearty dose of sriracha sauce and a shot of what is described only as Chinese liqueur. Speculated variously to be baijiu; rose-scented rice wine; or Ng Ka Py, a spirituous infusion of the root bark of Cortex acanthopanacis, one way or another it adds up to an umami-laden drink that underscores how tropical cocktails have been sustained and expanded through the efforts of Asian American restaurants and bars. We wanted to apply Li Po's concept to a drink from the Don the Beachcomber canon, the Queen's Road, a Daiquiri variation already edging a bit toward the culinary through augmentation with ginger and honey. What would the power of hot sauce enable it to become? Sriracha amplifies the ginger and honey, no doubt, but perhaps too much. We can see that other successful ginger drinks, like El Diablo and Florodora, contrast the strong hit of ginger with fruit: cassis in the case of the Diablo, and raspberry for the Florodora. For this drink, we employed strawberry, and the balance was complete. These are all bold ingredients, which the full-bodied Appleton Estate can stand up to. The name for this drink comes from the Li Po poem “A Message to Meng Haoran.”"

      "Spiced rums are as widespread and varied in the Caribbean as herbal liqueurs are in Europe. Complex infusions of barks, roots, peels, seeds, pods, and stalks express the creativity of the blender and the heritage of the region. Although such spiced rums have played a relatively small role in the tropical cocktail ecosystem, a similar artistry of spice-blending using syrups has been a critical part of the culture since the days of Donn Beach. Donn's wells were full of house-made syrups that could be mixed and matched to form endless combinations and permutations. During Jeff Berry's long quest to recover lost cocktails of Donn's era, one of the hardest to pin down was the Nui Nui, its two syrups recorded only as “Don's Spices No. 2” and “Don's Spices No. 4.” As he explains in Sippin' Safari, Jeff determined that No. 4 was cinnamon while chasing down a bartender's clue that No. 2 could be replaced with “spiced rum.” He compared every commercially produced spiced rum and found that their most common flavors were allspice and vanilla—so No. 2 must be equal parts allspice dram and vanilla syrup. Thanks to Jeff's tireless efforts, this Donn classic was drinkable once again, and it quickly became a favorite of the cocktail revival. But since it was his own insight into the ingredients that made it possible, the drink as we understand it owes as much to Jeff Berry as Don the Beachcomber. If someone else had made the reinterpretation of Spices No. 2, would we have a different Nui Nui today? Fortunately, we don't have to contemplate that trip into the Twilight Zone. But it does suggest that other spices might have a place in tropical recipes. For our Lost Navigator, we retain the vanilla and cinnamon from the classic Nui Nui, but in place of allspice we turn to cardamom. At ZZ's Clam Bar in Manhattan, bartender Thomas Waugh created a drink featuring gin, Chartreuse, and cardamom tincture, and we were sufficiently delighted by the integration of this underused spice to adapt it for our own purposes. We also opted to retain Thomas's medium: displaying cardamom in a concentrated tincture instead of a syrup preserved our water allocation for other ingredients. Our final flourish is a dusting of five-spice powder that makes the Navigator's spice-forwardness known from the start. Rather than shaking powder directly onto the surface of the drink, we dust the orchid garnishing the drink, ensuring that even as the drink is consumed the spice stays to offer its aromas. This was inspired by Trader Vic's technique of making flower garnishes do extra duty by scenting them with orange flower water. (If you're lacking orchids, dusting the surface works, too.)"

      "Unlike gin, which traditionally focuses on juniper, aquavit draws inspiration from a wide range of herbs and spices. Dill has a special place in Scandinavian hearts, and the dill aquavit from Gamle Ode is exceptional enough to build a drink around. Dill and coconut come from different parts of the world, but they have found affinity in innovative contemporary vegan cooking. With the Kiruna Cooler, we apply that thinking to the format of the Coconaut, an original Jeff “Beachbum” Berry beverage. The name of our drink also derives inspiration from Jeff's original, as Kiruna is the northernmost town in Sweden and home to the Esrange Space Center. How's that for expanding the scope of tropical drinks? First appearing in Grog Log in 1998, the Coconaut is an appealing mix of coconut cream, lime juice, and aged Jamaican rum. Jeff concocted it due to his dissatisfaction with the sweet-acid balance of the Piña Colada. “While playing around, I slowly realized that rum and coconut don't really need pineapple so much as they need lime,” he told us. “It's a more satisfying tropical trio, which of course was not my discovery: Harry Nilsson got there first with his song lyric ‘Put the lime in the coconut, then you'll feel better.'”Along similar lines, we wanted to see how coconut cream, associated with sweeter drinks, would work when pulled in a savory direction. But swapping the rum for aquavit left out all-important body, so we split the base with aquavit and two rums of different character. Sommeliers often cite dill and coconut as defining characteristics of American oak barrels, so a rum with a dry, woody burn to it will mesh with the other ingredients while bringing the solidity of wood back to the drink. This is the role Scarlet Ibis plays, while Banks backs up the vegetal notes. Trader Vic himself developed the garnish used here. He noticed that cutting hashes in a cucumber makes it intensely and refreshingly aromatic, and he used that technique to add those notes to drinks that otherwise contained no cucumber. In the Kiruna Cooler, this allows the drink to start off with coconut and end with cucumber—a fascinating journey for the senses."

      "In Jamaica, and throughout the Caribbean, roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) flowers and other spices are steeped in water or rum to make sorrel. It's a staple of Christmastime celebrations but is tartly refreshing at any time. Sorrel is not one recipe but an idea with hundreds of iterations. Commonalities generally include cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. One new iteration arose by accident when Garret made a batch of sorrel but accidentally omitted the ginger. Ginger brings a needed bite to sorrel, but Garret didn't want to throw away otherwise good liquid, so he combined the gingerless batch with another experiment: serrano pepper–infused overproof rum. And what a beautiful thing these flavors are together. The sweet and sour elements of this sorrel rum punch could reflect another Jamaican staple, the Wray and Ting, so into the recipe went lime juice, grapefruit punch syrup, and soda water. The effervescence of the soda unlocks the qualities of the sorrel, which delivers copious spice flavor even while diluted. The name derives from a song on the soundtrack to the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No by Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. The band was introduced to the film crew by a young production assistant named Chris Blackwell, whose musical connections were notable enough that the label he cofounded, Island Records, would help bring reggae and ska to the world. His family also once controlled Jamaican rum giant Wray & Nephew. (The title of the song is given variously as “Jump Up” and “Jamaica Jump Up,” but the lyrics do include the call to action “Jump up, Jamaica,” so that's what we're going with.)"

#Acid Adjusting
  - name: PKNY
    notes: |+2
      Jost Van Dyke is a sparsely inhabited haven among the British Virgin Islands, an archetypal fantasy of tropical seclusion. It was chosen by American expats George and Marie Myrick, pioneers in the yacht charter trade, as the site of a small beachfront hotel and bar they constructed in 1971. The unassuming Sandcastle Hotel and Soggy Dollar Bar became destinations, and their house drink, the Painkiller, became an illustrious delicacy. As George tells it in his 2008 memoir, Incredible Virgin Island Adventure, prior to opening their bar, “Marie and I came up with a very tasty rum drink. Our mix consisted of orange juice, pineapple juice, and coconut cream. We added the coconut cream slowly until we said, ‘Wow, this is it!' We sloshed it over some measured ounces of rum—Mount Gay or Cruzan Gold—dealer's choice. Last, but not least, ground nutmeg was sprinkled on top.” He credits Marie with the inspiration to name their creation after a local bush. The Painkiller is much in the spirit of the drinks in this book, as the Myricks were tinkering with the flaws and eccentricities of its antecedent, the Piña Colada. Their version was easier to make, as it was shaken instead of frozen, and it added an assertive rum character and spice notes. But in inserting a second juice, it supplied new complications. It's for that reason that the drink is a perfect showcase of the acid-adjusting technique. Instead of two low-acid juices, we let the pineapple do its thing while bringing proper acidity to the show by transmuting our orange to the level of lime. Some bartenders have attempted to bolster the Painkiller's tartness by directly adding lime juice, but a third juice, with its extra dilution, only compounds the troubles. Acid adjusting allows a lower volume of juice to do more flavor work. Dave Arnold developed the technique with orange juice in mind. “You don't really expect half an ounce of orange juice to do anything to a drink,” he told us. “But once it can function as the acid foundation, you get a lot of orange flavor characteristics coming through, too.” With lower dilution, the rums also come to the fore, enhancing this drink's purported painkilling properties. To reinforce this we use a blend of rums, with Hamilton 151 bringing the beef and Smith & Cross and Coruba working in concert to approximate the strong flavors of the days when Jamaican rums ruled the waves. To strengthen the notes of nutmeg, the complementary spice profile of Angostura bitters is added. Finally, the drink is flash-blended to whip the enzymes and proteins in the pineapple and coconut, bringing a significantly lighter texture. In addition to being the birthplace of the Painkiller, Jost Van Dyke had earlier been the point of origin of William Thornton (1759–1828), the architect of the US Capitol and the first superintendent of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Perhaps it is for this reason that, unusually among cocktails, the name Painkiller has become a registered trademark. Despite the creation of the drink and its name forty years earlier by the Myricks, Pusser's Rum Ltd. filed for trademark protection for “Painkiller” in 2011 and prevailed upon the Patent and Trademark Office to register it for alcoholic drinks and cocktail mixes. Thus armed, Pusser's dispatched cease and desist letters to bars that served drinks under the name Painkiller. Pusser's is a good rum, but this practice brought the company some infamy. A chief casualty of the legal campaign was the New York bar also known as Painkiller, whose owners were sued by Pusser's in federal court for trademark infringement. The bar settled out of court and adopted the moniker PKNY before ultimately closing in July 2013. In honor of PKNY's contributions to the advancement of tropical beverages, we've flipped the script and redubbed our recipe accordingly (although we should note it's not the same formula that was served there).

      "California was the cradle of the midcentury tropical drink craze, with Don the Beachcomber operating from Hollywood and Trader Vic's out of Oakland. Riding in their wake was Beverly Hills socialite Steve Crane, who promoted his Kon-Tiki chain by keeping himself in the tabloids with exploits involving Hollywood celebrities, including marrying and divorcing Lana Turner two times in as many years. With marketing, rather than kitchen or bar skills, as his strength, Crane's menus drew heavily on the work done at Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic's. Kon-Tiki's house Mai Tai closely copied Donn's Q.B. Cooler, but its menus also featured interpretations of many of Vic's non-rum cocktails. This was a category notably underemphasized at Donn's establishments. It was important at Trader Vic's and the Kon-Tiki as they were hotel bars needing to capture all guests, not only those nursing a tropical island fantasy. Among these non-rum drinks at the Kon-Tiki was the Western Sour, derived from Trader Vic's Eastern Sour and substituting grapefruit, lime, and falernum for orange, lemon, and orgeat. The presence of lime helps the Western Sour avoid the pitfalls of another whiskey and grapefruit cocktail, the Brown Derby, whose bourbon-grapefruit-honey formulation risks runaway sweetness, runaway dilution, or both. In adding lime, though, a new problem was created in the Western Sour: the malic acid of the lime abrogates the wood notes prominent in bourbon. This effect can be pleasant in tall drinks such as the Bourbon Special, but in a sour the whole purpose of using an aged spirit is defeated. Once again, acid adjustment allows us to have the best of both worlds. By increasing the grapefruit's acidity to that of lemon, we can achieve the balance of a traditional Whiskey Sour without need of lime, keeping the bourbon profile intact and clearing the decks for the subtle lime zest notes of the falernum. We serve the Western Sour like a contemporary Whiskey Sour—shaken with big ice and strained over a rock—in order to let the drink open slowly."

    notes: |+2
      "When mainland tourists familiar with Californian “rhum rhapsodies” began to flood Hawaiʻi, they searched in vain for what they believed were native beverages, especially the Mai Tai, a drink with no genuine connection to Hawaiʻi or Polynesia. As a consequence, tourist-friendly versions began to appear. The original Trader Vic Mai Tai is a restrained affair, consisting of rum, lime juice, curaçao, and orgeat. Many of these new tourist versions also included a fruit that was to Hawaiʻi what the orange was to Florida: pineapple. (And while they were at it, they threw orange in, too.) Today, this juice-forward variation is sometimes designated as the island-style Mai Tai, and it's still dominant in Hawaiʻi and resorts worldwide. Craft bartenders tend to look down on it, believing its delicate flavors disappear under a juice tsunami, but we can offer it new life through the magic of acid adjusting. The basis comes from the drink as it was served at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel's Surf Bar around 1971, which boasted four acids, three sweeteners, and three rums. In contrast, our version is built more like an old-school Mai Tai. Pineapple becomes the only component carrying the acid. There is still lime, but oil rather than juice. It's a kind of friendship bridge between the classic Mai Tai and the Hawaiian style. The proportions of this drink are the same as our regular Mai Tai, which shows how acid-adjusted juice can be easily slotted into a template. In addition to a strong Jamaican rum flavor, here supplied by Coruba, the Royal Hawaiian's original spec includes Demerara and light Puerto Rican rums to add a bit of roundness. In this version, the Saint Lucian Chairman's Reserve plays that role. Like other Vic-derived drinks, it uses the hybrid shake."

      Most fruits have been bred to increase sugar and lower acid, in line with many people's preferences. But there's one citrus where the acid adjusting is already built in. The calamansi (sometimes called calamondin in English) is a cross between a kumquat and a mandarin. It clocks in at around 4.5 to 5.8 percent citric acid, close to a lemon, but with a unique flavor of its own. While a staple of Filipino cuisine, it's largely unknown to most Americans. At the Mai-Kai, drinks with orange juice have a particular tang that isn't easily reproduced with regular orange juice. It's unknown what they might be adding to enhance the flavor, but the calamansi's super-sour orange-ishness seemed like a possible way to re-create it. Unlike adding lime to a Painkiller, updating a Mai-Kai classic like the Deep Sea Diver (their version of Donn's Pearl Diver) with calamansi doesn't make the new fruit the star of the show; it inspires the orange to get its act together and toughen up. In the Philippines, calamansi juice is often cut with honey, so the honey-inflected Deep Sea Diver makes sense in at least two ways. All of this, of course, would have been known to Mariano Licudine, the Filipino American bartender who helmed the program at the Mai-Kai after a tour of duty with Don the Beachcomber. Boiron's puree makes this drink easier to concoct, although your local Asian market may have fresh calamansi to experiment with, as well. The Pearl Diver and Deep Sea Diver are showcases for Demerara rum, so our version begins with the Hamilton 86. Barbancourt brings dry wood while the Doctor Bird adds fruity funk. “Full fathom five” is, of course, Shakespeare's lingo for the sufficient depth for burial at sea. Remember to come up for air when sampling this delicious drink.

#Sugar Adjusting
  - name: Derby Daiquiri
    notes: |+2
      "The Kentucky Derby and its Mint Julep so definitively established the expectation of a big horse race involving an official drink that the Florida Derby, founded in 1952, required its own. The trade organization Rums of Puerto Rico sponsored the “Order of Rums Royal” cocktail competition at Miami Beach's Eden Roc Hotel on November 10, 1958. Seventy entries, including Mai-Kai head bartender Mariano Licudine's Derby Daiquiri, were judged. It's not entirely clear what happened at the competition: Several local columnists reported they would be among the judges, voicing some concern that seventy samples were about sixty-eight too many, but they did not write of the result, perhaps being physically unable. Nevertheless, Licudine's drink was proclaimed the official drink of the Florida Derby in February 1959, and began appearing in ads from Rums of Puerto Rico the next month, and for a decade or so thereafter. Licudine took the standard Daiquiri and added the state's most famous product, orange juice. But as we've seen throughout this book, orange juice can be the downfall of many a drink. The Daiquiri must provide a sharp hit of acidity, derived from an exacting proportion of components. Orange juice, with more water and less acid than lime, is too weak to provide sourness but not sweet enough to balance the lime. One solution might be to replace both orange and lime with orange acid adjusted to lime, but that would lose the flavors unique to lime, and complementing these two fruits is the whole point of the Derby Daiquiri. Instead of combining the juices, we'll combine orange with sugar, concentrating its flavor in a syrup and doing away with excess water through sugar adjusting. The original Derby Daiquiri was flash-blended, but to accommodate the way our recipe is put together, it should be shaken for aeration and controlled dilution. Flashing this recipe would aerate the cocktail, but, even with a small amount of ice, the results would be far more watery and full of ice shards than should be the case with a Daiquiri at its zenith. The addition of orange citrate bitters adds bright orange peel and vanilla. To honor the drink's legacy with Rums of Puerto Rico, we've chosen to showcase Don Q Gold, a delicious exemplar of the style. The recipe stands up to experimentation with different types of orange—try it with Cara Caras or mandarins. But steadfast Valencia oranges are always a safe bet in this Derby."

      As mentioned earlier, the Derby Daiquiri originated as a flash-blended drink. At some point, probably the early 1970s, the Mai-Kai added a number of frozen fruit Daiquiris to its menu, and the Derby Daiquiri followed in taking this form. Here's our version. In frozen applications, orange has a more prominent role, so acid adjusting is needed. Lime zest provides the aromatics of the lime that were lost to this process. Denizen White's more aggressive presence can stand up to the slush, but the imbiber should be sitting down.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 1½ tablespoons white sugar
    - ¾ ounce orange juice, acid adjusted to lime
    - 2 ounces Denizen Aged White Rum
    - ¼ teaspoon xanthan gum
    - Channeled lime twist, for garnish
    - Orange slice, for garnish
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients, except the xanthan gum, in a blender. 
    - Dry blend (without ice). 
    - Once the sugar is fully dissolved, slowly add the gum while continuing to blend. 
    - Add 170 grams of crushed ice while continuing to blend. 
    - Pour into a large, chilled coupe (10 ounces).

      "Turning fresh juice into syrups is a time-honored method of extending the span of seasonal fruit, and sugar-adjusted syrups preserve not just their existence but their flavor balance. Freshly squeezed blood orange juice is a luxury that complements many spirits. However, the juice can only last a few days in the fridge, whereas a syrup made from blood orange can last at least a month longer. The height of the blood orange's season is the winter, but the citrus makes for beautiful long drinks suited for warmer weather. Extending its shelf life will allow blood orange to gambol in the springtime. From Dusk till Dawn is inspired by the Cadillac Margarita. The Cadillac Margarita nomenclature has been applied to a series of Margarita variations, but the general idea, as evidenced by the name and exemplified by its use at Spago in the late 1980s, is premiumization. In Spago's case that meant applying the then-new Patrón Tequila and fancier-than-triple sec Grand Marnier. In our case, we will deploy two contrasting orange flavors: heady, wooded Grand Marnier and juicy, fresh blood orange syrup. Instead of the now-ubiquitous Patrón, Siete Leguas Reposado is our call for a premium Tequila. Its beautiful balance between minerality and wood earns it a place in this reinterpretation of the “high-end” Cadillac Margarita. Trader Vic's Pinky Gonzalez, essentially a Tequila Mai Tai, also resembles this drink, though here the blood orange syrup takes on orgeat's role. Oddly enough, while the Pinky Gonzalez is not pink, the From Dusk till Dawn is break-of-day fuchsia."

      The Pineapple Daiquiri is currently enjoying a reconsideration by craft bartenders, but versions have been around for a long time. Trader Vic himself offered a rendition he called the Rhum Cosmo, named after his San Francisco bar's location on Cosmo Place—a pioneering appearance of the word Cosmo on cocktail menus more than seventy years ago. But San Francisco had a lust for pineapple much earlier than that. In the 1870s, the local cocktail cause célèbre was Pisco Punch, a concoction that definitely featured Peruvian brandy and pineapple gum syrup and may also have employed cocaine. Such were Pisco Punch's effects that it was said the drink would “make a gnat fight an elephant.” (We like to think that luscious pineapple was the cause.) Precise recipes aside, it's evident that while juice syrups have always been rarer than fresh juice in cocktails, pineapple was being consumed in that fashion fairly early on. So how to set about strengthening the Pineapple Daiquiri with a syrup backbone? Like our forebears in “Baghdad by the Bay” (as San Francisco was known), we want our pineapple syrup made with acacia gum, an emulsifier and thickening agent that enhances the rich texture already found within pineapple. It also preserves the foam of the pineapple better in a shaken drink—and isn't half the enjoyment of a good Pineapple Daiquiri in the creamy head found on top? Another inspiring pineapple drink is chronicled by Charles H. Baker Jr., who reported on leche preparada piña (pineapple milk) endemic to San Salvador. Brewed from fresh pineapple, milk, vanilla, sugar, and either brandy or rum, the “truly delicious beverage” is credited by Baker with inducing “chronic invalids to take up their—and other—beds and walk.” (Yep, definitely the pineapple!) Adding milk directly to a Pineapple Daiquiri did not appeal, but milk washing seemed like an excellent way to extract additional notes from the complex bouquet of pineapple. This technique can be done in a few ways, but at Existing Conditions the practice was to mix whole milk and a spirit and then add citric acid to break the mix into curds and whey. Once broken, the liquid could either be strained through a coffee filter or spun in the centrifuge, removing the curdled solids but leaving whey proteins in the liquid. The whey provides a creamy texture and, when shaken, a frothiness similar to that provided by heavier egg whites. A final flourish is oolong infused into one of our rums. A splash of pineapple in iced tea never fails to create an alluring combination of tannic complexity and juicy refreshment, and the pairing works just as well in this more layered drink. We have assembled a proud potation worthy of a Pineapple Princess.

      We can't tease you without providing a spec for the drink that made pineapple gum famous. In this version, the tendency of both absinthe and makrut lime tincture to slightly numb the tongue hints at one (and only one) of the effects of the cocaine-fortified wine that may have been in the original. El Floridita included an anisette rinse in its Pisco Punch, so there is a historical basis for the addition. But the amounts of the numbing elements are minute enough not to distract from the drink's pineapple focal point.

      Here's another drink documented in The Gentleman's Companion by Charles H. Baker Jr. He discovered it at the Stranger's Club in Panama City, Panama, which catered to international trade through a certain canal. Think of it as a Gin Fizz with raspberry syrup. The raspberry gives this bird its plumage. But an appropriate raspberry syrup is hard to find. Commercial versions vary wildly in quality, and making it at home can result in a consistency too close to jam or, worse, water. It's a brilliant drink with a tricky ingredient. Sugar adjusting sounds right for the job, but how do you adjust whole fruit? Using a vacuum sealer to bag all the ingredients allows you to cold process this syrup, avoiding the changes to flavor characteristics that would come with doing it in a saucepan. We want fresh fruit, not jam. The less broken up the raspberries are, the better. Whole raspberries will turn the sugar into a rich syrup without contributing much extra water. For our Bird of Paradise, the raspberry syrup is backed with raspberry eau-de-vie from St. George. The syrup brings fresh juice but the eau-de-vie contributes other aspects of the fruit, an aromatic shadow in the background. Cream, that age-old partner of the berry, plays the sweet role in this drink. To linger in the moment, we'll add soda, Ramos Fizz style. For the gin base, you stand at a crossroads. The recommended choice is Old Raj Red Label, with its classical London Dry botanicals plus an extra hit of saffron, to really kick the raspberry into gear. But for a different experience, try Mahón Xoriguer, heralding hearty black pepper notes in an unaged brandy base, which enhances the drink's eau-de-vie aspect.

      Around 1937, Donn Beach whipped up a drink that, even in his varied oeuvre, stands out as a bit unusual. He called it the Caribbean Punch, despite the fact that this did not distinguish it from all his other drinks that were also inspired by some form of punch from the Caribbean. Rather, its focus on sarsaparilla grounded it in the soda fountains of his youth. In The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink, contributor Ruth Tobias notes that sarsaparilla “may evoke images of languid belles and parched cowboys,” but despite its antique, romantic image, it's not completely relegated to the past. Today's root beer and birch beer are from the same lineage, although bottlings of properly old-fashioned sarsaparilla can be hard to come by. Instead, let's make our own sarsaparilla syrup. In the Caribbean Punch, there were several sweeteners at work whose flavor we want to preserve, but we don't want our version to be too saccharine. This is where sugar adjusting can truly shine, as we can make our syrup at any level of sweetness. In this case we'll aim for 25 Brix, half as sweet as the usual 1:1 syrup. When it's diluted with ice and cut with soda water, it will resemble the degrees Brix of bottled soda but with much more flavor. (See here for a discussion on sugar adjusting.) Embracing the soda fountain aesthetic, the Languid Belle combines three different syrups, just as soda jerks would add a little bit of this and that to formulate their latest offerings. With its strong barrel tannins, Barbancourt goes remarkably well with root beer–like flavors. Panamá-Pacific is on hand to dry out the host of other ingredients.

      "Both Donn Beach and Trader Vic had versions of a drink called the Navy Grog. The Trader formed his around a “grog concentrate,” and while he published many recipes in his lifetime, this ingredient was never revealed. As the years went by without even the suggestion of a leak, the drink achieved mythic status due to its unavailability to the home bartender. Below is our attempt to conjure a simulacrum, based on the known evidence. Instead of revealing the Navy Grog recipe, for those who wanted to re-create it at home, Vic offered a bottled grog concentrate at retail. While his company does continue to sell many premade mixes, the Navy Grog mix has been available only intermittently in recent years. However, we've sampled vintage bottles in the hands of truly dedicated collectors. The report: Among the variety of spices in the mix, the most prominent is allspice, among an abundance of high-fructose corn syrup. Meanwhile, in another corner of the galaxy, a fan recipe posted to an online forum attempted to rekindle the version of grog concentrate found at the defunct Honolulu Restaurant of Alexandria, Virginia. The Honolulu, a local hangout keeping the midcentury tropical dream alive until its closing in 2004, was run by David and Anna Chan. David had worked for many years as a bartender at Trader Vic's in Washington, DC, during its heyday. The central conceit of this online reinterpretation of Chan's version of Vic's syrup was its basis in Coca-Cola. This makes sense due to commonalities in flavor, but it's hard to miss the irony of using a top-secret blend of spices and water in re-creating another top-secret blend of spices and water. In adding our own level of reimagination onto this syrup, Coke was swapped out for Mexican Coke, due to its reliance on sugarcane instead of corn syrup. The syrup now goes like this: take Coke, add allspice, sweeten to syrup level—and you're done. There's already a lot going on in Coke. (For more thoughts on Coca-Cola, see the Bay of Pigs here.) The rum blend for this Navy Grog is based on the rums specified in the recipe from Trader Vic's 1972 Bartender's Guide. In addition to his commercially produced mix, Vic calls for equal portions of 86 proof Demerara, dark Jamaican, and light Puerto Rican rums. These rums are included here, except for a switch of Barbancourt White for the latter, due to its affinity with grapefruit."

#Preserving Citrus
  - name: Hearthside Punch
    notes: |+2
      Cognac punch was a staple of celebrations in the eighteenth century, and lemon sherbet was the rock that punch was built upon. The winter holidays seem more festive with a Cognac punch in hand. Perhaps the fruity brandy recalls warmer days. There are countless recipes for punches made with brandy; here's an amalgamation of some of the best ideas. In particular, tea is an evergreen punch constituent. Its tannins, similar to those found in the oak barrels in which spirits are aged, impart gravitas in the same way. Water is a vital part of punch, as punch should be more dilute and easier to sip than a cocktail. Once it's been poured over ice, a cup of this beverage should be roughly the strength of wine. This drink can be mixed à la minute, or it can be batched ahead of time and bottled. To serve four people, multiply the recipe by five. Depending on your group, it will make for a memorable holiday season or one magical evening.
    glassware: punch glass
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - ½ ounce strained lemon juice
    - ½ ounce lemon punch syrup, 55 brix

    - ½ ounce Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum
    - 2 ounces Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal Cognac
    - 1¼ ounces water
    - Grated nutmeg, for garnish
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients to a mixing glass and stir without ice. If not serving immediately, bottle and refrigerate.
    - To serve, pour into a punch glass (8 to 10 ounces) filled with cracked ice.

  - name: Pimm's Tropicale
    notes: |+2
      "James Pimm operated a series of successful oyster bars in London starting in 1823. Pimm, or perhaps one of his successors in the business, concocted a spiced gin liqueur sold as an aid to digestion. That concoction, Pimm's No. 1 Cup, became surprisingly popular, in large part due to the rise of the similarly named Pimm's Cup cocktail—Pimm's liqueur and lemon soda or ginger ale, lavishly topped with mint, cucumber, citrus, apple, or strawberries—which even now remains a summertime favorite across Britain. The Pimm's Cup somehow found its way to New Orleans by the 1940s, where it has been unashamedly embraced. It's de rigueur at the bar of the Napoleon House, a Gallophilic grog shop where the Brit favorite is a free-poured medley of Pimm's, lemonade, and 7Up—never the same way twice, yet always a refreshing diversion from humid French Quarter afternoons. Craft bar interpretations of the Pimm's Cup cocktail differ; those focusing on the ginger ale might turn it into a buck, those entranced by the garnish might turn it into sangria. In his 1951 book The South American Gentleman's Companion, Charles H. Baker Jr. describes a party in Rio at which the Pimm's Cup cocktail is denigrated and dismissed until a brave defender suggests an adaptation more befitting their tropical latitude. The secret ingredients: a splash of (only sort of tropical) lime cordial and a (downright English) extra pony of gin. As much as we admire the lateral thinking exhibited by Baker's co-celebrant, we opt to draw our inspiration from the libation the Napoleon House has been dutifully doling out all these years, supercharging it with a combination of juices and punch syrups in place of the lemonade. In addition to its gin-based Pimm's No. 1, the distiller once sold a full range of different base spirits with their proprietary spice mix. In the 1930s, Pimm's No. 4, with Caribbean rum, was introduced. Its memory is an inspiration here. However, the Pimm's Tropicale also works with the more traditional gin. Just substitute Tanqueray for Chairman's Reserve. You can juice a cucumber by grating it with a cheese grater, gathering the bits in a nut milk bag, and squeezing."

      As the craft cocktail revival gained steam, Audrey Saunders's Pegu Club was its boiler room. Its menus were developed particularly to introduce a new generation to the possibilities of mixed drinks. Pegu Club became a drinking academy for the ages, easing the vodka and soda crowd into unimagined pleasures like Calvados, Chartreuse, pisco, and rye. Audrey was always cognizant of her role as envoy, conducting these experiences into the lives of her guests. When Pegu opened in 2005, the cocktail most guests were prepared to request was the Cosmopolitan. The bar needed to provide the next step for such imbibers; it created several “Cosmo killers” to entice and enlighten the neophyte. Two such drinks were the Intro to Aperol, created by Audrey herself, and the Aperol Sunset, created by Pegu Club bartender Jasper Milne-Soffer. Both are lively and light, showcasing the citrusy aperitivo Aperol. The drinks, delicious in their own right, also served as a gateway to bitter drinks, as the Intro name suggests. “When Aperol finally became available in the US market, I created the Intro to Aperol to introduce it to the American palate,” Audrey told us. “While I really like Aperol, I was never a fan of the Spritz. From my personal perspective, I find the sugar lingers on my palate even after being carbonated and diluted. I always felt that its high Brix, low ABV profile needed the support of an acid. Campari's strong, bitter profile was an acquired taste for many at that time. But Aperol was softer and more approachable, a gentle bitter.” She combined it with gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, and Angostura bitters—shaken, up, with a flamed orange twist—and palates were thoroughly introduced. Jasper conceived a Margarita riff—Tequila, Aperol, lemon juice, grapefruit syrup, and Demerara syrup—which became the Aperol Sunset. “Since Aperol has a much lower ABV than Cointreau, he needed to integrate other flavors that would support it and help it shine,” Audrey said. “He subbed lemon for lime, as lime would have locked with the Tequila and stepped on the Aperol. Grapefruit syrup instead of grapefruit juice provided a muted, restrained brightness, keeping the grapefruit from becoming too assertive.” After considering the lessons of these two Pegu Club drinks, as well as the similarly themed Cuzco by Julie Reiner, we saw the opportunity for another bitter tropical drink outside of the Jungle Bird lineage. In the Puesta del Sol, the more deeply rhubarb-flavored Select aperitivo meets the hearty Uruapan Charanda rum. Select, halfway in bitterness between Campari and Aperol, features several unusual notes, including juniper berries and the aforementioned rhubarb. The complex layers of the Uruapan, blended from both cane juice and molasses, balance the salacious juiciness of the grapefruit punch syrup. All together, it could be your Intro to Select.

#Cordials
  - name: Rangoon Gimlet
    notes: |+2
      The British Empire left a complicated legacy for the world. It also left a number of iconic drinks, like the Gin and Tonic, Pink Gin, Gimlet, and Pegu Club. The Rangoon Gimlet is an amalgamation of these colonialist cocktails. In midcentury tropical bars of Los Angeles, like the China Trader and the Tiki-Ti, the Rangoon was a standard gin option. It was served frozen at the China Trader, while the Tiki-Ti flash-blended it on crushed ice. (The frozen recipe from the China Trader's Tony Ramos is available in Jeff Berry's Taboo Table.) In our version, the drink undergoes a transformation in the opposite direction to that of the Slushy Dog, exploring how nuances can be unveiled by converting it to shaken form. Lime cordial is the key. The drink is a cross between a Pink Gin and a traditional Gimlet, served up. The heavy hit of Angostura, from the Pink Gin, cooperates with the lime cordial from the Gimlet. The cleaner flavor of the clarified juice is a stronger platform for the bitters while the oily texture of the cordial brings body to the drink. After this recipe had been created, we inevitably found an analogue in the pages of Baker's South American Gentleman's Companion, the Bin-'n'-Gitters. It takes a similar compounding approach but with a much higher heaping of colonialism in the unbelievable personage of Commander J. K. L. Ponsonby-Foulcques, the drink's inventor. (At Milk & Honey, Sasha Petraske offered this drink as a swizzle with fresh lime and a float of bitters.) You have a choice of gins depending on what you want to emphasize. Old Raj, which adds saffron to the traditional London Dry profile, brings another layer of spice on top of the Angostura. Plymouth brings out the citrus. On a particularly hot day, the drink can be served on cracked ice in a tumbler; Plymouth works best in this serve. Unusually among the drinks in this book, a spent lime wedge is shaken in the tin. This adds one more layer of lime, contrasting fresh oils with the preserved ones.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1 lime wedge
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 4 to 5 dashes Angostura aromatic bitters
    - ¾ ounce lime cordial, 55 brix
    - 2 ounces Cadenhead's Old Raj Blue Label Gin or Plymouth Navy Strength Gin
    - Channeled lime twist, for garnish
    steps:
    - Squeeze a lime wedge to remove the juice, discard the juice, and place the spent wedge at the bottom of a shaker.
    - Add the remaining ingredients to the shaker with 1 medium cube and 2 small cubes. 
    - Shake and strain into a chilled Nick and Nora glass (5 ounces).
    - Garnish with a channeled lime twist.

    notes: |+2
      Without easy access to proper cordials, most craft bars have turned to making the Gimlet in the style of a sour. A true Gimlet, with a silky, stirred texture and the spirit prominently in the foreground, is more akin to a Martini than a Daiquiri. Lime cordial tames the gin and provides a bang of citrus flavor but stops well short of limeade. The jasmine and high citrus tones of Fords Gin harmonize with the lime cordial. But if you want something more classically assertive, Beefeater is the way to go. The drink is presented here on the rocks but can also be served up. The extra water from being served on the rocks balances out the acidity of the lime and lime cordial, so if you do serve it up, make sure that it is properly diluted beforehand. It is possible to compose this cocktail with freshly squeezed lime juice instead of clarified. While the clarified juice is a touch cleaner in flavor, regular juice still presents a beautiful counterpoint to the cordial. As long as you carry lime cordial in your luggage, this classic will be within reach anywhere you roam.
    glassware: goblet
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 1 teaspoon lime juice; preferably clarified lime juice

    - Combine all the ingredients in a mixing glass filled with small ice cubes.

  - name: Bourbon Special
    notes: |+2
      "At Existing Conditions, clarified cordials worked much like syrups at a soda fountain. Lime cordial was added to water, spirits, and other modifiers to produce a range of carbonated drinks. This suggested that the cordial technique could also be used to bring other soda flavors to drinks that are otherwise difficult to replicate à la minute in the craft cocktail manner. Ginger beer is a great example. The usual solution is that of the Sasha Petraske school, incorporating ginger syrup and fresh citrus. In this book, El Diablo takes this approach. It works well in many recipes. But others need more than just spice and acidity, as certain ginger beers and ginger ales have more shades of light and shadow that need to be addressed. An à la minute ginger beer made from lime cordial, ginger syrup, lime juice, and soda water brings the unique tang of ginger beer to cocktails, with the citrus oils offering depth that juice alone would not. The combined sweet-acidic burst of lime cordial is crucial to this drink; it could not be replicated with lime juice and simple syrup. The original Bourbon Special was another whiskey-forward creation gracing the menus of Steve Crane's Kon-Tiki chain. It's a tropical take on the classic Rickey, which started out as a whiskey cocktail before morphing into a gin drink. As its story goes, circa 1883, lobbyist Joe Rickey wanted a cooling drink to suit the punishing Washington, DC, summers, so he called for his booze to be cut with fresh lemon and soda water (but no sugar, in a foreshadowing of Hemingway's preferences). His choice of lemon over lime has been disregarded by bartenders ever since, and the Rickey has become synonymous with lime-based drinks even though highballs more typically pair whiskey with lemon. The Kon-Tiki's Bourbon Special uses ginger beer in place of the Rickey's soda water, and then adds a touch of falernum for complexity and a needed balancing of sweetness. In the Western Sour, the Kon-Tiki's other whiskey and lime drink, those key ingredients don't quite interlock because the highly acid lime diminishes the effects of the whiskey's oak aging. (This problem is addressed in our version of the Western Sour.) But in the Bourbon Special, that diminishment is actually what you want: The lime cordial cuts through the heavy oak aging of the whiskey, while still preserving the spirit's fruitier notes."

    notes: |+2
      Bossa nova albums are known for taking jazz standards in unexpected directions. The Só Danço Samba (named after the João Gilberto and Stan Getz collaboration, translated as “I only dance samba”) does this for the highball. In the two previous recipes, we've seen how the cordial technique can replicate and build upon old-style cordials and sodas. The current drink needs pineapple and makrut lime leaf, which is outside the traditional pantheon of flavor combinations. Lime cordial is the map to the treasure. Makrut lime leaf tincture is the hero of the drink, working alongside a small measure of lime cordial to conjure a tropical soda that heightens the rest of the ingredients. Big-flavored mixers, used in small quantities, allow the drink to be served diluted in the refreshing highball style. The same highball method from the Kingston Zing is used here, building the drink in the glass with a highly chilled spirit from the freezer—a technique at the basis of highball culture in Japan.
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:
    - 5 drops salt solution
    - 6 drops Bittermens Winter Melon Bitters
    - ½ teaspoon makrut lime leaf tincture
    - ⅜ ounce pineapple juice, acid adjusted to lime
    - ½ ounce lime cordial
    - 2 ounces Novo Fogo Silver Cachaça (freezer temperature)
    - Soda water
    steps:
    - Combine all the ingredients, except the cachaça and soda water, in a shaker. 
    - Whisk with a milk frother (or, if not available, stir until uniform) and set aside.
    - Fill a chilled highball glass (12 ounces) with small ice cubes. 
    - Add the cachaça, then add the soda until the glass is ¾ full.
    - Pour the contents of the shaker into the glass while holding the glass at a 45-degree angle. 
    - Top with more soda until full. 
    - Agitate the mixture with a single brisk dip of a bar spoon.

  - name: Improved Rum Cocktail
    notes: |+2
      The cordial technique can be applied to fruits other than lime, as illustrated by the Beachcomber Negroni, which adapts the cordial approach via the grapefruit-based Don's Mix. Another common ingredient in midcentury tropical drinks is passionfruit, with the flavor administered in many ways. Passionfruit liqueurs are readily available, but they're a mixed bag. They can be clear or cloudy, sweet or dry, neutral or assertive. Their main function isn't to deliver accurate passionfruit flavor in a range of applications but to offer shelf-stable convenience compared to passionfruit puree. By making a clarified passionfruit cordial we can open up the flavor for reliable use in stirred drinks. In the late nineteenth century, several drinks that underwent changes to their recipes garnered the qualifier “Improved.” The Improved Whiskey Cocktail and the Improved Gin Cocktail were at the forefront, though the Improved Rum Cocktail had to wait an extra century or so for our attention. (For another take on this idea, see the Romero.) The improvements that those drinks saw were an extra splash of imported liqueur, such as maraschino, curaçao, or absinthe. In the Improved Rum Cocktail, established tropical flavors from the canon are all present but delivered in unusual ways. Fruit is present without juice, through clarified passionfruit cordial as the sweetener. The structure is inspired by the original 1937 version of the Beachcomber's Gold, with its strong anise and almond notes ricocheting off Jamaican rums, plus Donn Beach's later Waikīkī version, which incorporates the aforementioned passionfruit. The Improved Rum Cocktail presents high-quality rum the same way the original Improved Whiskey Cocktail can highlight a well-made whiskey. The right blend for the drink is funky, but not so funky that all the layers can't be perceived. The three rums chosen here create a similar profile to a pot-stilled, aged rum as it would have been known in the Jerry Thomas era.

#Liqueurs
  - name: Bronze Swizzle
    notes: |+2
      "In the earliest decades of the previous century, many travelers to the Caribbean had a particular item on their agenda: to sample the Green Swizzle. The cocktail, known across the region's English-speaking islands, was praised in travelogue after travelogue—rarely, though, with any hint to its contents. A more insightful mention comes from a letter to the editor of The Sun of New York, in the days when newspapers covered new and popular cocktails like liquid celebrities. A reader from New Jersey, signing himself “Jerseyman,” had on more than one occasion trumpeted the mixological achievements of his state, especially as they sprung from locally produced spirits like applejack. Proving that trans-Hudson smack talk is eternal, an exasperated reply from a New Yorker identified as “Swizzle Stick” was published on October 26, 1903: What do we care about pear trees and peach trees, or how many there are of them in bloom? Let “Jerseyman” tell us something about the green swizzle, and see if he can make it with applejack. It is made with a swizzle stick. I'll give him that pointer to start with, and if “Jerseyman” has ever twirled one between his palms I need say no more. If he has not, he has something still to live for. . . . The sailor does not pass the Isle of Sombrero [the northernmost island of the Lesser Antilles] on his equatorial journey before the smell of the ripening swizzle stick greets his nostrils. Then comes the aromatic Falernum. . . . Then there is wormwood bitters, as noble a product of the soil as was ever brewed. These were all mixed together in some inexplicable way, well iced and swizzled, and needed only a dash of Angostura on the top to give it color, and there is your green swizzle. Thus, we received a toehold on the formula: falernum, wormwood, and Angostura. Falernum, a celebrated product of Barbados, has passed through many stages. It may have originated as a punch of rum, ginger, lime, almond, and clove or allspice. Later it was a prepackaged liqueur of those ingredients. Today, that tradition is continued in brands such as John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum, still produced in Barbados, but the craft cocktail world has also embraced a gamut of nonalcoholic syrup versions. In our green-gold Bronze Swizzle we'll conjure verdancy with rolling waves of lime, delivered by falernum, punch syrup, and fresh juice. Wormwood comes courtesy of the Bësk liqueur, a potable wormwood bitters with layers of dill, grapefruit, and juniper. The result isn't quite green, but it's a potent flavor combination that brings freshness to the swizzle style."

  - name: Scarlet Fog
    notes: |+2
      In Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide of 1947, nestled among the 1,500 recipes, is the Fog Cutter, an unusual shaken drink with rum, gin, brandy, lemon juice, orange juice, orgeat, and—uniquely within the tropical canon—a cream sherry float. Despite it being difficult to balance and dependent on good floating technique, the drink has remained fantastically popular. Yet there is another Fog Cutter roaming the wild, where the same split base is augmented with sour mix, deprived of orgeat, flash-blended, and topped with a float of cherry liqueur in lieu of sherry. The drink appears in Ted Haigh's Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails with the recipe and commentary provided by Tony Ramos, a legendary bartender who worked spots in the Los Angeles area including Madame Wu's Garden, the China Trader, and Don the Beachcomber's Hollywood flagship. Tony posits that the drink wasn't originally Vic's at all, but the signature beverage at a Hollywood steakhouse called Edna Earle's Fog Cutters (which, at the very least, existed). A similar Fog Cutter is prominent at the Tiki-Ti, which their menu claims was their most popular drink before the advent of the Ray's Mistake. Did Tony create the oddball cherry version or preserve its legacy? And why cherry instead of sherry—perhaps the result of someone shouting out ingredients in a noisy bar? We may never know, but it served as the point of entry for this iteration, which puts the distinction front and center. The two sweeteners in Tony's drink are sour mix and the cherry liqueur float. We could have tapped punch syrup or cordial to stand in for sour mix, but the intensity of cherry flavor we sought wasn't likely to come from a commercial cherry liqueur. So we'll lean on our house-blended red fassionola for cherry, incorporating lime through fresh juice and lemon through limoncello (which brings the booze we lost with the liqueur). With these three flavor powerhouses, we've managed to regulate dilution enough to slip in splashes of fresh orange juice (à la Vic) and invigorating soda (à la the Ti). As the convoluted fog disperses, a delightful vista is revealed. “Fog cutter” is an early Americanism, traced to at least 1833, for an early morning tipple, akin to “eye opener” or, indeed, “cocktail” itself.

#Ray Buhen and the Tiki-Ti
  - name: Ray's Mystique (à la Ray's Mistake)
    notes: |+2
      "A “lost” ingredient of the ancient cocktail world is the syrup known as fassionola. Its Sphinx-like riddle continues to confound bartenders. Was its flavor passionfruit, as the name sort of suggests? Was it a medley of tropical fruit, as in many of its current reimaginings? How do we interpret older recipes that call for it? And since fassionola seems to have come in gold, red, and green, what was the difference? Syrups made from a composite of different flavors are a mainstay of the Don the Beachcomber oeuvre, but before that they figured prominently in the toolbox of soda fountains. The 1897 Standard Manual of Soda and Other Beverages reports seven variations on what was known as Ambrosia Syrup, which contained combinations of citrus, berry, and vanilla. Ambrosia, of course, was a sustenance of the ancient Greek gods, as was nectar, which also found itself interpreted as a soda syrup. In Cincinnati and New Orleans, nectar is known as an almond and vanilla matchup, but sometimes in the historical record the “nectar” appellation ends up on “ambrosia”-like fruit syrups. (In Greek mythology, too, the names were often swapped around.) Fassionola is in that tradition: another glamorous name applied to a combination of fruit and sugar, for the glorification of our beverages. It appears in Donn Beach drinks from the 1930s like the Pi Yi and Cobra's Fang, and in the Pat O'Brien Hurricane of the 1940s, which was itself based on a Ronrico recipe that explicitly included passionfruit syrup. The San Diego–based Jonathan English Company was and is the most well-known purveyor of fassionola. It claims its recipe dates to 1914, although the company formed in the '50s, was dissolved in 1984, and revived under new ownership in the subsequent decade. Jonathan English still produces its varicolored varieties, and while they are not generally available at retail, to serve our mission and you, our thirsty readers, we tracked down some bottles for a serious sampling session. While sharing commonalities, each of the English bottlings of fassionola is distinct in its taste. The gold combines pineapple, vanilla, and passionfruit. Red has a cherry-strawberry-raspberry flavor. Green is heavy on lime, but also exhibits guava and passionfruit. While many modern adaptations of recipes calling for fassionola substitute passionfruit syrup, the English products have more dimensionality, which suggested their application to new drinks. So, what does this have to do with the Tiki-Ti? Well, possibly nothing. The Ti keeps its secrets close, which includes the majority of its ingredients. We don't know that they use Jonathan English or any other fassionola in their drinks. But they are certainly aware of those products and their flavors, as well as their heritage with Don the Beachcomber. It certainly seems possible that the Buhens could have been inspired by these flavor combinations when creating their cocktails. In any event the flavors we found in the gold and red fassionola syrups kickstarted a discovery process that led to the two recipes in this section. The gold inspired our homage to Ray's Mistake, while the red conjures the Toro, Toro, Olé! As for green, we need to hang on to something for a rainy day. Ray's Mistake is the marquee cocktail at the Tiki-Ti, which comes complete with its own legend: In 1968, founding bartender Ray Buhen put the wrong ingredient into a drink he was mixing, but the customer preferred it that way. Since then, the Ray's Mistake has been one of the Ti's crown jewels and its recipe is accordingly guarded. However, in early 2020, the Ti released its most detailed menu to date—and, for the first time, with drink descriptions! Therein, the Mistake is said to contain “passion, lime, gin, dark Jamaican rum float, and our secret flavoring which has a hint of vanilla.” Passionfruit and vanilla recalled elements of the gold fassionola. Could a quasi-Mistake be assembled from the idea of fassionola and the list of flavors from the menu? Instead of concocting a gold fassionola just for this drink, we'll build it from elements we already know. Let's stick with the sturdy passionfruit puree featured throughout the book, as it is the best delivery for that flavor. We can pull in vanilla-sandalwood syrup and pineapple gum syrup, which are also already in your repertoire. All together, this combination is a craft reinterpretation of gold fassionola, forming the basis of our heavily researched homage to Ray Buhen's serendipitous masterpiece. What the master formed in one blithe moment, the rest of us are still trying to fathom."

    notes: |+2
      When Spanish novelist Vicente Blasco Ibáñez's 1908 fictive contemplation of bullfighting, Sangre y arena (Blood and Sand), was adapted by Hollywood into a 1922 vehicle for Rudolph Valentino, it was honored with a cocktail bearing its name. The Blood and Sand—an up drink with equal parts Scotch whisky, Cherry Heering, sweet vermouth, and orange juice—is an unusual tipple with no particular aura of duende, but it's been a staple of the craft cocktail revival as one of a precious few Scotch cocktails. The film was remade in 1941 with Tyrone Power, but it took longer for the drink to get a second look. In the 1970s, Ray Buhen updated it for the Tiki-Ti by replacing Scotch with Tequila, adding lime, and flash blending it. This balanced the acid and water content, while preserving the smoky, hearty flavor—a huge step forward for the drink. At the Ti, the Blood and Sand is revered enough to merit its own special ritual. Whenever it's ordered, the bartender lets a wind-up toy bull totter along the bar as the whole room chants, “Toro! Toro!” For this refresh, Cherry Heering suggested red fassionola's cherry-oriented delights, providing the way into this drink's interpretation. To add back a bit of tangible torero, we considered the Mexican tradition of pairing Tequila with Sangrita, a side shot that is sometimes savory and tomato-based, but can also be a citrus and chile combo. Echoing the chile's spice are Bénédictine's herbaceous honey notes. Don your traje de luces and prepare to engage with this raging toro.

#Mariano Licudine and the Mai-Kai
  - name: Rum Drum (à la Barrel O'Rum)
    notes: |+2
      "Of Donn Beach's many creations, his Rum Barrel ranks as one of the most widely imitated across the diaspora of bars trying to replicate his aesthetic. Imitators tended to simplify Donn's formulation of multiple rums, juices, and sweeteners in ways prioritizing efficiency (with few iterations that stand out in a world of limitless rum punch variations). But in our opinion the Rum Barrel never really ranked among the best of Donn's work to begin with. At the Mai-Kai, Mariano Licudine made a brilliant, deceptively simple modification: He discarded all sweeteners save honey and passionfruit syrup, which also conveys tartness. Suddenly, layers of citrus were unveiled and the drink made sense. The changing availability of rums over the decades has made the Mai-Kai's Rum Barrel (served under the more playful moniker Barrel O'Rum) a moving target. While Jamaican rums never disappeared en masse, workarounds had to be found whenever a particular brand was discontinued. Drinks that might have called for Dagger in the 1950s turned to Appleton Punch in the '70s, and finally Kohala Bay in the '90s (all distilled by Wray & Nephew in Jamaica). When Kohala Bay was removed from the market in 2016, the Mai-Kai began creating its own blend from several commercially available Jamaicans, and we will, too. The Rum Barrel should be easy-drinking while still revealing layers—not an easy task to accomplish with any drink, but here the key is how the blend of rums interacts with the blend of citrus. Worthy Park and Coruba bring complementing characteristics of Jamaican rum that are now hard to find in a single distillation, while the 151 Demerara totes additional firepower. As in the Full Fathom Five, backing orange with calamansi amplifies the signature tang of Florida citrus. Note that Angostura bitters are an especially important part of the package; make sure you heave in three proper dashes. Due to the popularity of the Rum Barrel, there are many barrel-shaped ceramic mugs on the market, but most are oversized for our version of the drink. We suggest a 16-ounce beer mug, which can also be found in barrel motifs."

  - name: Incantation (à la Black Magic)
    notes: |+2
      In proper dining tradition, the Mai-Kai presents a list of after-dinner drinks, including the Kona Coffee Grog, set ablaze tableside like Café Brûlot à la Broward County. But, since its inception, the Mai-Kai has made more innovative use of coffee in Mariano Licudine's mixture of fresh brew, rum, and citrus—the Black Magic. On the Mai-Kai's immense menu, it stands out for its special bite. In the 1930s, Donn Beach developed the Jamoca, which Jeff Berry in Sippin' Safari termed an “early experiment” with coffee in a tropical drink, but it's in the Black Magic that coffee found its role within the tropical palette. Unlike the Black Russian, where coffee liqueur provides sweetness, or the Irish Coffee, where it acts as the acid, in Mariano's Black Magic coffee works in concert with an array of tropical juices. After all, coffee is itself a tropical fruit. While the Mai-Kai uses hot-brewed coffee that has cooled, for our tribute we'll be calling upon cold-brewed concentrate. Slow extraction manages the acidity, so the coffee won't overwhelm the juices in the mix—as the Mai-Kai menu puts it, “smooth but forthright.” The biggest mystery surrounding the Black Magic is not the coffee but its sweetener. Jim “Hurricane” Hayward, writing on his website, The Atomic Grog, has reported that the Black Magic employs an element known only as No. 7 syrup. Black Magic fans have spun many theories as to its makeup, and to this day we do not know with absolute certainty, but we have learned (thanks to Berry's second edition of Sippin' Safari) that Don the Beachcomber used the label No. 7 for his ginger syrup. Knowing that Mariano was working in the Donn tradition, we think it more likely than not that the rhizome plays a role in the Black Magic. For our Incantation—as delicate as its inspiration—our standard ginger syrup is too intense. With the drink's honey and coffee, our more floral ginger oleo harmonizes perfectly. The structure of this drink has commonalities with our Rum Barrel homage, outlining the house style of the marvelous Mai-Kai. The blend of rums is similar, with a few adjustments to correlate with coffee.

#Harry Yee and the Hilton Hawaiian
  - name: Blue Leilani (à la Blue Hawaii)
    notes: |+2
      "In 1929, the French surrealist Paul Éluard wrote, “La terre est bleue comme une orange”—the Earth is blue like an orange. He might have been off about the planet as a whole, but about that little bit of paradise known as the Blue Hawaii—Harry Yee's cocktail that's blue by sight, orange by taste—it's strangely prescient. As a rule, comestibles aren't blue, so those that are prove particularly arresting. The world of drinking is suffused with aquamarine-tinted drinks, which have a reputation for leaning on their visual appeal rather than true gustatory justification. Which is why we want to rescue the Blue Hawaii from those who would do it wrong. The liqueur curaçao, made from dried peels of the bitter orange, is naturally clear. In the first half of the last century, a fad developed for recasting it in various unnatural hues like green, red, and especially blue, which spirits producer Lucas Bols offered by 1912 as “crème de ciel”—cream of the sky. There are four pages of blue curaçao drinks in the Café Royal Cocktail Book of 1937, though The Savoy Cocktail Book of 1930 hedges its bets by specifying both orange-flavored Cointreau and blue-colored vegetable dye. A notable ancestor to the trend is the liqueur Parfait Amour with its indigo tone and vanilla-citrus finish. If we contemplate the white sand beaches of Waikīkī slipping into the famously blue Pacific, can we fault the urge to invite a bit of blue into a resort cocktail? To be sure, the Blue Hawaii was built to the requirements of a resort—fast execution by the bartender, slow sipping by the guest—but Harry's bespoke spec is fruit-forward and multilayered, with vodka letting the notes of pineapple, lemon, and orange lap gently over each other. Harry named his late-'50s drink for a song from the 1937 musical film Waikiki Wedding. Bing Crosby, the film's star, released “Blue Hawaii” as the B side of “Sweet Leilani.” Leilani is a popular Hawaiian name, literally meaning “heavenly garland of flowers,” but figuratively meaning “heavenly child,” as children were carried on their parents' shoulders like a lei. The combination of the two tracks inspired the name of our version of this drink. Of course, the return of the song “Blue Hawaii” in the 1961 Elvis movie of the same name certainly helped to bring attention to the cocktail. As its popularity grew, the Blue Hawaii drew imitators. A particularly vexatious one, going by the almost identical name Blue Hawaiian, was simply a Piña Colada over-sweetened with blue curaçao. As a result of this muddying of the cerulean waters, even in these enlightened times bar-goers are likely to receive a Blue Hawaiian when ordering a Blue Hawaii. Our offering, the Blue Leilani, is a bridge over those troubled waters, connecting the coconut of the Blue Hawaiian to the original Blue Hawaii's multifaceted fruits. This is made possible by fat washing: mixing a lipid in its liquid state into a liquor and then cooling it to a solid for removal. Fat washing captured the imagination of the drinking public thanks to Don Lee's Benton's Old Fashioned, served at PDT in 2007, which brought together two traditional Southern foodways by infusing bacon into bourbon. But it also works with vegetable fat. Coconut oil's melting point around room temperature is particularly convenient for the process, and it's perfect for our purposes. Because fat washing removes some dominant notes from the spirit, we can start with something less neutral than vodka. We turn to Plymouth Gin, trusting that the oil will remove much of the juniper bite while leaving some citrus notes to linger beneath the coconut, an elixir worthy of Yee's fruit-layering masterpiece."

  - name: Frozen Banana Daiquiri
    notes: |+2
      "It's hard to imagine that there was ever a world without the Banana Daiquiri, but someone, sometime, had to invent it. The earliest someone with a documented claim on that distinction is one Don Ramon, who, according to the September 19, 1946, edition of the Miami News, won first prize for his Banana Daiquiri at a cocktail competition held during the Wine and Food Society of New York's “A Tasting of Cooling Rum Drinks for Summer” event at the Hotel Pierre on June 27, 1946. Harry Yee has also claimed to have been the first to put a banana in a Daiquiri, in the 1950s. It's perfectly plausible that Harry made this development without knowledge of Ramon's antecedent, and certainly it's his Banana Daiquiri that was introduced to generations of holiday-makers, cementing the drink in the tropical canon. The Banana Daiquiri is an important milestone because it's perhaps the first drink placing bananas in a sour, rather than creamy, context. Before that, there was the Banana Cow (see our discussion along with the Banshee, here). Trader Vic was an enormous and lifelong proponent of this massively milky mixture, which spent the 1930s as the house specialty at Trad'r Sam in San Francisco. It was pitched mostly as a stomach tonic for the hung over. In contrast to the complexities of the Blue Hawaii, the Banana Daiquiri offers simple pleasures. It's a whole fruit Daiquiri that's different because the banana is a different kind of fruit, and the rest of the drink just needs to clear its path. In this drink, banana is both a flavor and textural element, which is why adding banana liqueur to a Frozen Daiquiri isn't a practicable shortcut. Freezing the banana, as is done with strawberries in the Frozen Strawberry Daiquiri, also won't work, as it causes the flavor to become too candied. Ripeness, even over-ripeness, is key: rescue a banana in its final moments of edibility. Instead, use the freezer for your rum. This helps the temperature drop faster in the blender, causing less dilution. The delights of the Frozen Banana Daiquiri deserve to be in concentrated form."

#Victor Bergeron and Trader Vic's
  - name: Yacht Rock (à la Tortuga)
    notes: |+2
      "The Tortuga is one of Trader Vic's most baroque creations, sporting a lineup of hearty spirits that take it into Zombie territory. While it may have been devised to compete with some of the especially strong Beachcomber offerings, its roots are, as with many Vic drinks, back in Old Havana. Constantino Ribalaigua Vert's Floridita Cocktail is a Daiquiri variation with crème de cacao, curaçao, grenadine, and sweet vermouth—one of the few classics to borrow the confectionery pairing of citrus and chocolate. Vic supercharged this formula in the Tortuga, adding 151 proof Demerara rum and 123 proof Cuban rum, while also turning the up drink into a tall one over crushed ice. The Yacht Rock is to the Tortuga as that drink was to the Floridita—a tribute that steps things up. To focus on the chocolate and orange medley at the heart, sweet vermouth has been bisected into two ingredients: Campari amaro and vermouth de Chambéry. Campari bolsters the citrus while the vermouth's vanilla tones enhance the chocolate. Seeing Campari, vermouth, and rum under the same roof sent our thoughts to the Negroni format, specifically the Kingston Negroni by the charming and talented Joaquín Simó, and we let those pleasant memories direct our rum selection. The Yacht Rock is a rare tropical drink incorporating bitterness yet not based on the Jungle Bird. (Not to brag, but we even have another one in this unusual category; see the Puesta del Sol here.) Vic included drinks with amari in his publications (such as Fernet Branca in the Don't Give Up the Ship from his 1947 Bartender's Guide), so Campari would not be out of character for him. If you find yourself sailing around any of the islands named Tortuga in the Caribbean, Pacific, or Gulf of Mexico, load up Steely Dan and Gerald Rafferty on the LP changer and give this drink a try."

  - name: Red Sky at Night (à la Port Light)
    notes: |+2
      While both Trader Vic and Donn Beach prized their original recipes as trade secrets, Vic let at least a little information trickle out in his series of bar guides, and amidst the fervor over the Mai Tai, many Trader Vic–derived drinks became centerpieces on the menus of his imitators. Though most of those bars have long since closed, intensive research efforts by cultural historians like Jeff Berry have recovered records that provide a rare glimpse into how bartenders reinterpreted these drinks even in the midst of their initial popularity. The ambitious Kahiki Supper Club opened in Columbus, Ohio, in 1961 in a towering A-frame building reminiscent of a war canoe. Inside was a fantastical conception of a South Seas village, with bars and dining tables under thatched roof huts, approached by a bridge over a moat, and leading to a fireplace in the mouth of a stone Moai statue three stories high. The Port Light, a Trader Vic staple, also became a signature for the Kahiki, albeit with modifications. The two Port Lights shared bourbon, passionfruit, and lemon. Where Vic goes all-in on texturizing the drink with honey and egg white, the Kahiki version lets grenadine provide extra viscosity. Our Red Sky at Night adopts a spicy rye backbone to knit together both conceptions. The Minoan and Winter in L.A. are flash-blended with egg white, but neither is poured over crushed ice like the Red Sky at Night. Here, Vic's combination of egg white and honey foments a huge head of foam to disseminate the drink's aromatics. At Trader Vic's, the Port Light was served in red glassware in the shape of a ship's lantern from the Imperial Glass Company of Bellaire, Ohio (a couple of hours down the road from the Kahiki). A complementary green glass was used for the Scotch-based Starboard Light. If you have that vintage glassware, now is your time, but please note that Imperial Glass tumblers do not currently meet the requirements under international law for navigation lights on a seagoing vessel.

#Donn Beach and Don the Beachcomber
  - name: Donn's Demon (à la Zombie '56)
    notes: |+2
      "The Zombie unveiled by Donn in 1934 is the standard most people swear by, but its formulation was not known until Jeff Berry revealed his extensive research in Sippin' Safari, released in 2007. Before that, the only published recipes purporting to be a Don the Beachcomber Zombie were to be found in Louis Spievak's 1950 cookbook Barbecue Chef and a 1956 issue of men's magazine Cabaret Quarterly. All three are distinct. The 1934 original is deep in mythic lore, and sports the mysterious Don's Mix absent from the others. (See here for a discussion of the Mix.) The streamlined spec from 1950 performs well for passionfruit fanatics. But the 1956 iteration has found less love. As it's from Donn's later years, and specific to his Waikīkī bar, investigating it is a method of fathoming the progress of his craft. Like most of Donn's 1934 lineup, the original Zombie is based on the rich, pungent, spicy Planter's Punch as served in its homeland of Jamaica. By the 1950s, Donn had refocused the drink on the tropical juices that had become popular with consumers. (At the International Market Place, Donn installed a fresh pineapple juice stand.) The 1956 Zombie exhibits signature touches of Donn's, such as falernum spice, the combo of absinthe and bitters, and the zing of grapefruit. But it adds more layers of fruit, suggesting that Donn recognized that guests visiting Hawaiʻi would expect a different style of Zombie. As Donn's spec includes a maraschino and grapefruit pairing, integral to the Hemingway Daiquiri, we will apply the same solution: grapefruit punch syrup instead of juice. With grapefruit now a sweet rather than tart element, the role of the other juices can also be reconsidered. Pineapple becomes tart through acid adjusting. This balances the punch syrup but also enhances the fresh pineapple flavor. By reversing the roles of these fruits, the 1956 spec comes into focus. Grapefruit perfumes the drink and pineapple adds lovely layers of texture. The Zombie rises again."

  - name: Doctor Funkenstein (à la Doctor Funk)
    notes: |+2
      "Dr. Bernhard Funk, from the town of Neubrandenburg in the north European duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, stepped off a steamer in the Samoan capital of Apia in 1879. “Because Apia was ‘the nexus that joined Samoa to a foreign world', the small port-side community was also a cesspool of introduced disease,” Leilani Burgoyne explains in her 2007 paper, “Going ‘Troppo' in the South Pacific: Dr. Bernhard Funk of Samoa, 1844–1911.” “The arrival of a fully qualified medical practitioner and surgeon who was prepared to live and work in Apia was therefore greeted by local residents as a long-awaited blessing. . . . Funk was an anomaly in that he was a non-missionary qualified doctor and was also willing to treat both settlers and the indigenous Samoans alike.” Whatever Dr. Funk's talent for medicine, his enduring fame owes at least as much to his prescription of absinthe. “Herr Funk was better known in the [Tahitian social club] Cercle Bougainville than Charcot or Lister or Darwin,” Frederick O'Brien wrote in Mystic Isles of the South Seas, his 1921 romantic portrait of the region. “I had been introduced to a Doctor Funk by Count Polonsky, who told me it was made of a portion of absinthe, a dash of grenadine—a syrup of the pomegranate fruit—the juice of two limes, and half a pint of siphon water. . . . It would restore self-respect and interest in one's surroundings when even Tahiti rum failed.” The thought was profound enough to have continued from his previous volume, White Shadows in the South Seas, where O'Brien noted that the concoction offered “an imparting of courage to live to men worn out by doing nothing.” A fellow traveler in the tropics, Donn Beach took up Dr. Funk's recipe and added it to his own repertoire, first fortifying it with dark Jamaican rum and continuing to make a number of refinements over the years. Other bars put their own spin on it too: The Tiki-Ti converted the base to gin and Trader Vic's rebalanced the citrus. Our version imagines how Donn might have approached its reconfiguration for his bar at the International Market Place in Waikīkī, with a reinvigoration of tropical fruit like many of Donn's other drinks of that period. Their bouquet buffs the absinthe while a lighter yet assertive mix of rums, we hope, restores your interest in your surroundings. Since the 1970s, there's been no way to escape the fact that the word “funk” has been completely captured by the efforts of George Clinton and his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. It's now a core term for describing characteristics of music—and rum as well. In addition to his aural innovations, Clinton is a yarn-spinner, with his songs and albums parading a colossal list of dramatis personae, many developed with and portrayed by artist Pedro Bell, including Sir Nose d'Voidoffunk, Rumpofsteelskin, and Clinton alter ego Doctor Funkenstein. (Which means this drink may be the first to receive its nomenclature from the complex lineage of Bernhard Funk, Donn Beach, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, and George Clinton.) Among Clinton's many brilliant coinages is “funkentelechy,” combining the funk with entelechy, the complete realization and final form of a concept. Here, accordingly, we draw the curtain on our shared tropical drink journey. May everything you do be funky from now on."
