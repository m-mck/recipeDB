  - name: The Connaught Martini (Gin)
    notes: |+2
      Whether it is the gin or vodka version, The Connaught Martini is an aromatized Martini that has been served following the same ritual since the day we opened the newly refurbished bar. It’s a distillation of the Connaught Bar ethos – it’s about approaching our guests. We want our new guests to get excited about what we do with our classic service, and we want our regular guests to feel comfortable and yet excited about trying something new.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1/2 teaspoon bitters of choice
    - 1/2 oz vermouth blend
    - 2 1/2 oz vodka of choice
    - Lemon twist or green olive
    steps:
    - "To make a martini with a twist: Using a dropper, gently pour the bitters around the rim of a frozen martini glass or coupette. Combine the vermouth and spirit in a mixing glass filled two-thirds with large ice cubes and stir until well chilled. Strain into the prepared martini glass, raising the mixing glass high to add aeration to the drink and squeezing the lemon twist into the drink as the liquid passes into the glass. Garnish with the lemon twist." 
    - "To make a martini with an olive: Using a dropper, gently pour the bitters around the rim of a frozen martini glass or coupette. Prick the olive three times with a cocktail stick (toothpick) and let a little juice run out into the glass. Combine the vermouth and spirit in a mixing glass filled two-thirds with large ice cubes and stir until well chilled. Strain into the prepared martini glass, raising the mixing glass high to add aeration to the drink. Garnish with the olive skewered onto the cocktail stick."

  - name: 21st Century

      The 21st Century takes a cue from the classic 20th Century cocktail, which was created by bartender C. A. Tucker and featured in William J. Tarling’s 1938 volume the Café Royal Cocktail Book. A blend of London dry gin, crème de cacao, fresh lemon juice and Kina Lillet – a more herbaceous predecessor to today’s Lillet Blanc aperitif. We decided to twist this classic sip into a softer version of another classic, Harry Craddock’s Corpse Reviver No. 2, which was featured in Craddock’s 1930 cocktail compilation The Savoy Cocktail Book. Our version has a citrusy edge like the Corpse Reviver No. 2, but the chocolate notes combine with the hint of spice from the rye in the genever to make this a very special modern update.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - Edible gold paint, to decorate the glass 
    - 1 3/4 oz Cacao Nib-infused Genever
    - 2/3 oz fresh lemon juice
    - 2/3 oz Sugar Syrup
    - 2/3 oz Lillet Blanc
    steps:
    - Brush the base of a coupette with edible gold paint and set aside. 
    - Combine the genever, lemon juice, sugar syrup and Lillet Blanc in  a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously until the drink is sufficiently chilled. 
    - Double strain into the prepared coupette.

  - name: Amber Black
    notes: |+2
      While the activated charcoal and coconut garnish provides a visual representation of our Amber Black’s name and character, the fundamental contrast is the balance of the bold flavours of cachaça and mastiha against soft Riesling and jasmine. While complementary flavours are a usual approach in a drink’s creation, sometimes opposites really do attract. And contrasting tastes highlight each other’s virtues. Korerima pods, native to Ethiopia, are unrelated but so like cardamom pods that they are sometimes called Ethiopian or false cardamom. However, here we seek the pepperiness unique to them as well as their fruity and perfumed character. You might expect a smoky and heavy drink with the blackness, yet this drink is light, sweet and rich, taking your mind from visual expectation to a very different visceral delight.
    glassware: white wine glass
    ingredients:
    - Neutral spirit, for spraying the glass
    - Powdered coconut and activated charcoal powder, for dusting the glass and to garnish
    - 1 1/2 oz Coconut and Coffee-infused Cachaça
    - 1/3 oz Korerima Pod-infused Mastiha 
    - 1 barspoon Riesling Verjus Cordial
    - 1/3 oz jasmine liqueur
    - 1 oz soda water, for topping
    steps:
    - Spray one side of a white wine glass with a neutral spirit and dust the same side of it with powdered coconut and activated charcoal powder with the help of a powder decorating shaker. 
    - Set aside.
    - Combine the cachaça, mastiha, cordial and liqueur in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled. 
    - Strain into a white wine glass over a chunk of ice. 
    - Top with the soda water. 
    - Garnish with powdered coconut and activated charcoal powder.

  - name: Animae
    notes: |+2
      A mellow, sparkling blend of white peach and Prosecco with hints of grenadine and lemon juice, the ubiquitous Bellini was a seasonal sparkling cocktail introduced at Harry’s Bar in Venice by the bar’s owner Giuseppe Cipriani shortly after he opened for business in May 1931. But Cipriani didn’t bother to name his special house aperitif until 1948, when a retrospective of Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini was exhibited in the ‘Floating City’. Our Animae pays tribute to this masterpiece in the art of sweet simplicity. It stirs animated feelings and emotions just like a fine painting, blending our house-made Clarified White Peach Purée and Oat Liqueur as the delicate enhancements in a vodka and champagne cocktail. But the soul of this drink is the garnish: a delicate peach sphere suspended in this crystal-clear cocktail. If you try to lift the sphere, you find you are piercing the Animae’s soul. 
    glassware: flute
    ingredients:
    - 2/3 oz vodka
    - 1/3 oz Oat Liqueur 
    - 1 oz Clarified White Peach Purée 
    - 1 1/2 oz champagne
    - "Garnish: Peach Sphere Water Cake"
    steps:
    - Combine the vodka, liqueur, peach purée and champagne in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled. Strain into a flute. Garnish with the water cake speared onto the end of a cocktail sword

      When we created this drink, it was not so much a nod to the guests from the United States who were temporarily trapped in London by the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, but a dark twist on a favourite libation, the Paloma. While the original is a mix of blanco tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda, our version adds sophisticated notes of fino sherry and washes the tequila with toasted sesame oil. The result is a toasty, subtly fruity sip that belies its spirituous nature.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - 1½ oz Toasted Sesame Oil-washed Blanco Tequila 
    - 1 oz Grilled Grapefruit Sherbet 
    - 1/3 oz fino sherry
    - 1/3 oz fresh lime juice
    - "Garnish: Black Isomalt Disc Studded with Sesame Seeds"
    steps:
    - Combine the tequila, sherbet, fino sherry and lime juice in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously until the drink is sufficiently chilled. 
    - Double strain into a coupette. 
    - Garnish with a black isomalt disc studded with sesame seeds.

  - name: Astor Special Fix
    notes: |+2
      Albert Stevens Crockett, historian of New York’s old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, questioned the origins of the Astor Cocktail. Was it a drink that was possibly created at the ‘old Astor House or the Astor Hotel’, and did it take its name ‘from its bar of nativity’? Or was this blend of gin and Swedish Punsch (a bottled mixture of arrack, brandy or rum with lemon, spices, sugar and water) crafted to honour namesake William Waldorf Astor, who first built the Waldorf Hotel? Whatever the answers, the Astor was the hotel’s signature cocktail after Waldorf’s cousin John Jacob Astor IV built the adjacent Astor Hotel and the two buildings were united before the turn of the century to form the Waldorf-Astoria – the world’s largest hotel at that time. Our version of the Astor is a special fix. While the classic drink consists of spirit, lemon juice and a sweet fruit, ours is more complex. It is made of wormwood-infused vodka, Matcha Syrup and a touch of egg white, which makes it creamier in both palate and texture. The use of egg white to enrich the presentation with light foaminess as well as maraschino liqueur also harkens to another cocktail classic – the Ramos Gin Fizz.
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 oz wormwood-infused vodka 
    - 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
    - 1/3 oz maraschino liqueur
    - 2/3 oz Matcha Syrup
    - 1/2 oz egg white
    - 1 3/4 oz soda water, for topping
    - "Garnish: Dried lime slices"
    steps:
    - Whizz the vodka, lemon juice, liqueur, syrup and egg white in a blender. 
    - Alternatively, you can dry shake these ingredients without ice in a cocktail shaker, then hard shake the mixture a second time in a cocktail shaker over ice. 
    - Double strain into a highball glass filled with ice. Top with the soda water and garnish with dried lime slices.

  - name: Avant-Garde
    notes: |+2
      Avant-garde: It is a word that encompasses the attributes of newness and experimentation in both conception and technique, especially in the worlds of art, music and literature. The essence of avant-garde can also be associated with the modern, forward-thinking movement seen in today’s food and beverage world. Avant-garde is the mantra that drives the spirit of experimentation we present in every menu and every drink served at the Connaught Bar, and this libation is a tribute to this sentiment. The enigmatic Avant-Garde cocktail invites you to step between dimensions – from the historic to the exotic. Vodka is infused with barberries and mulberries. The striking purple hue and spicy notes come from our house-made Chicha Morada – a Peruvian drink made from native purple corn, stone fruit and citrus spiced with cinnamon and cloves. On first sip, you notice that this drink is light on spirit, bright with fruitiness: clearly it is a drink that surprises you with hints of raspberry vinegar, vanilla-forward liqueur and lightly bitter amaro. Amaro Santoni is a liqueur made with thirty-four herbs. Its flavour is infused with undertones of citrus, olive leaves and iris and, above all, of rhubarb.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 oz Barberry and Mulberry-infused Vodka 
    - 1 barspoon Amaro Santoni
    - 1 oz Galliano l’Aperitivo
    - 1 1/2 oz Chicha Morada
    steps:
    - Combine the vodka, amaro, Galliano l’Aperitivo and chicha morada in a mixing glass filled ice and stir until well chilled. 
    - Strain into a coupette with a piece of block ice.

  - name: The Avenue
    notes: |+2
      When the United Kingdom Bartenders’ Guild was first organized in 1934, it was founded by two of London’s top bartenders: Harry Craddock of the American Bar at the Savoy and William J. Tarling, who presided over the bar at the Café Royal off Piccadilly. Both gentlemen compiled the recipes being mixed at London’s top bars. The Avenue appeared in Tarling’s 1937 volume the Café Royal Cocktail Book. Originally crafted by G. Crompton, it was a blend of bourbon, Calvados – a French apple brandy – and passion fruit juice with dashes of grenadine and orange flower water. We came up with a modernized version that is insidiously fresh and rich in tropical fruitiness.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2/3 oz reposado tequila 
    - 1 oz bourbon
    - 1/2 oz passion fruit purée
    - 2/3 oz fresh orange juice
    - 1 whole passion fruit, both pulp and seeds
    - 1/3 oz Rosehip Syrup
    - 2 dashes orange flower water
    - "Garnish: 1/2 passion fruit and edible flowers"
    steps:
    - Combine the tequila, bourbon, passion fruit purée, orange juice, passion fruit pulp and seeds, syrup and orange flower water in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously until the drink is sufficiently chilled. 
    - Double strain into a coupette, then float the passion fruit on top and garnish with edible flowers.

  - name: Bamboo
    notes: |+2
      Featured in the 1908 edition of ‘Cocktail Bill’ Boothby’s World Drinks and How to Mix Them, the original Bamboo is a sherry and sweet vermouth cocktail made famous by barman Louis Eppinger, who created the drink at his San Francisco bar on Halleck Street around the 1870s before he moved to Portland, Oregon, a decade later. His drink was already popular in the United States when he pulled up stakes and moved to Yokohama, Japan, where he managed the bar at the Grand Hotel and popularized his own creation among visiting American dignitaries and military personnel. This twist on the classic Bamboo was crafted by the team at the Connaught Bar in 2014. They modernized the recipe by reducing the sweetness, using a dry sherry and Coffee Bean-infused Extra Dry Vermouth and introduced additional spiciness by combining orange bitters with the house ginseng-bergamot bitters. If you cannot find ginseng-bergamot bitters, blend equal parts of a bergamot liqueur with a gentian liqueur.

    - 1 1/2 oz oloroso sherry
    - 1 1/2 oz Coffee Bean-infused Extra Dry Vermouth

    - 2 dashes orange bitters
    - "Garnish: Orange twist"
    steps:
    - Combine the sherry, vermouth and both bitters in a cocktail shaker filled with two-thirds ice and shake vigorously until the drink is sufficiently chilled. 
    - Double strain into a chilled coupette and garnish with a twist of orange.

  - name: A Beautiful Mind
    notes: |+2
      It is a thing of beauty: A mind that is open to learning the new and different is likened to a blank canvas that is receptive to inspiration and vision. It is a blank canvas for creation, just like the young barbacks (assistants to the bartenders) and bartenders who come to work and learn with us. This drink is a fruity palate cleanser that is deceptively spirituous. The crispness of Polish vodka works with the tart, astringent flavour of the quince liqueur to balance the sweetness of both the Clarified Pineapple Juice and the intensely sweet, pungent, balsamic aroma of Opopanax Syrup. Opopanax is the resin collected from the Commiphora guidotti tree, which is found in Africa and Asia. Sometimes this resin, which is used by perfumiers all over the world, is called sweet myrrh.
    glassware: highball
    ingredients:

      This take on a classic Bentley cocktail was crafted to celebrate the creation in 2016 of a new model Bentley automobile. The drink itself was made to be prepared in advance and served in the vehicle's little bar. If you cannot find ginseng-bergamot bitters, blend equal parts of a bergamot liqueur with a gentian liqueur.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 oz single-cask whisky
    - 2/3 oz fresh lemon juice
    - 1/3 oz sloe gin
    - 1/3 oz egg white

      A Bentley Cocktail is among the treasure chest of drinks that Harry Craddock, head bartender of the American Bar at the Savoy, included in his 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book. This blend of Calvados and a French aromatized wine, Dubonnet, inspired us to modernize the drink by adding an Asian touch: umeshu plum wine from Japan. The cherry and spice from the Peychaud’s Bitters add an edge of complexity to this very simple and satisfying pre-dinner concoction.

    notes: |+2
      A warm smile and open arms followed by a cheerful ‘benvenuti!’ greets friends, family and customers alike as the host welcomes all those who enter any door throughout Italy. This sparkling champagne cocktail celebrates the hospitality for which Italians are famed as well as the creation of a new ‘Ambrato’ style of vermouth di Torino, featuring floral and honeyed notes. With a fresh, herbaceous palate, this drink’s gentle pineapple aroma mixes with the nepitella, which is also called lesser calamint – a mint that is traditionally cooked with mushrooms in Pisa, Italy. The result harkens to afternoons languishing on sunny dry hills overlooking a deep blue sea.
    glassware: flute
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz pineapple rum
    - 2/3 oz Martini Riserva Speciale Ambrato
    - 1/3 oz Nepitella Mint Syrup 
    - 2 oz champagne
    - "Garnish: Diced pineapple piece"
    steps:

    - Double strain into a flute and slowly add the champagne. 
    - Garnish with a piece of diced pineapple speared onto the end of a cocktail sword, which replaces the bittered sugar cube usually found in traditional champagne cocktails.

  - name: Betty Is Back
    notes: |+2
      Betty is a joy … she is far the best cocktail mixer in the West End’, wrote a journalist in the 1940s about the Connaught Bar’s head bartender. She first learned her skills working for twelve years behind the bar at the Hind’s Hotel in Bray on Thames. With her well-honed talents she served Connaught Bar customers for fourteen years from the wartime years to a little beyond. This salute to Betty of the Connaught was the very first drink to appear on the refurbished Connaught Bar’s opening menu. Regular customers from when the doors reopened in 2008 love it so much they keep requesting it. Betty is Back is a dry, bubbly sip with delicate floral and citrus notes from a complex blend of Aperol – an orange, gentian, rhubarb and cinchona aperitif – and elderflower liqueurs and fresh lemon juice, while the champagne raises a toast to this memorable wartime bartender and her customers, who kept returning to this iconic spot for more.
    glassware: flute

    - 1 barspoon elderflower liqueur
    - 1 barspoon fresh lemon juice
    - 3 1/2 oz champagne

      This drink is dark and deceptive. It is made like a classic Vodka Martini but delivers so much more to the nose and palate. The stripe of black edible paint on the bowl of the glass sets the stage for this concoction of caviar vodka and crème de cacao with elegant notes of sherry, Calvados and Cocchi Americano, a wine-based aperitif that is aromatized with herbs and spices. Served with a wedge of salty cheese such as feta, Edam or Roquefort, this cocktail delights and surprises in its universe of the unexpected.

  - name: Bloody Mary
    notes: |+2
      A classic cocktail enjoyed before a meal, savoured before a Sunday brunch or on its own, the Bloody Mary was originally created by bartender Ferdinand ‘Pete’ Petiot and named by jazz pianist Ray Barton around 1920 at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. While the mixture was initially a simple blend of vodka and French tomato juice, it evolved over the decades when spicy elements such as Worcestershire, Tabasco and horseradish sauces were included in the repertoire. The celery stalk was added in 1966 at the Pump Room bar in Chicago’s Ambassador East Hotel. But we started a new tradition by finishing our Bloody Mary with a Celery Air that adds another layer of texture and freshness to a timeless classic.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - 1/3 oz fresh lemon juice
    - 3 1/2 oz tomato juice (if using American tomato juice, add a pinch of sugar to sweeten the juice) 
    - 2/3 oz Bloody Mary Mix 
    - 1 3/4 oz gin, vodka or tequila
    - "Garnish: Celery Air and a grating of nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Pour the lemon and tomato juices, Bloody Mary mix and spirit into a cocktail shaker tin. 
    - Pour the mixture back and forth from the filled shaker to an empty shaker two or three times. 
    - Strain into a coupette without ice and top with celery air and a grating of nutmeg.

      Light as a blossom on a breeze, the Blossom on the Branch cocktail is overflowing with sensory aromas that are as fresh and rejuvenating as a walk through an orchard in bloom. This drink evokes images of sakura or cherry blossom season in Japan, when everyone picnics under cherry trees across the nation, toasting under the falling petals. Make sure that you buy the fresh jasmine blossom from food suppliers so it is food-safe before using it to garnish the drink.

      ‘You turn the corner. What a change! All is light and brilliancy.’ That is how author Charles Dickens described the experience of walking into a drinking establishment in his 1833 story collection Sketches by Boz. It is a scene that is played out every day at the Connaught Bar. We were inspired by the mirror that presides over the actual bar, illuminating the magic performed as each drink is masterfully crafted. We were also inspired by a modern classic created by legendary American bar woman Audrey Saunders – The Old Cuban. (Think of a Mojito transformed into a champagne cocktail.) Our lighter, aromatic twist on this modern classic serves up fleeting impressions of coconut and extravagant spices such as saffron and hoja santa, which is also called Mexican pepperleaf or root beer plant. The overall impression is one of an exotically delicate Swiss lemon cream delight finished with a touch of sparkle.

  - name: Bubble Leaf
    notes: |+2
      When I first arrived at the Connaught Bar in 2008, I was inspired to craft an Italian twist on a staple in the Connaught Bar’s drink menu – the French 75. While many historians say this Parisian classic was invented by Harry MacElhone during the 1920s at the New York Bar, Robert Vermiere told a different story in his 1922 volume Cocktails: How to Mix Them. He wrote that the French 75 was introduced by bartender Henry Tépé at Henry’s Hotel on Rue de Volney, which was frequented by American ambulance drivers and aviators during the First World War. But when Henry died suddenly, Harry took up the mantle and popularized the drink at his place. Many versions have dictated champagne was the bubbly in the French 75. But I agree with the late Sasha Petraske of Milk & Honey in New York that the drink can sparkle with cava, Prosecco or other sparkling wine. The Bubble Leaf contains two very refreshing twists: the acidity of ice wine verjus (a highly acidic juice pressed from grapes or other sour fruit) plus the fruity sparkle of Italian apple and pear cider.
    glassware: flute
    ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 oz aromatic, floral gin
    - 2/3 oz ice wine verjus

    notes: |+2
      The roly-poly, fuzzy members of the bee family – bumblebees – seem to love a leisurely graze through the countryside’s bounty of flowers, coaxing them to bear the luscious berries we harvest from hedgerow to hedgerow. This Bumblebee is a twist on a modern classic – The Bramble. It has a dry, deep fruit texture but is not as fruity as its predecessor. The addition of champagne to this elegant gin cocktail lightens its berry richness with hints of toast and apple, with just the right amount of sparkle. Fatwashing (infusing alcohol with oily or fatty ingredients) vodka and gin in a mixture of berries, olive oil, salt and pepper makes this creation a salute to the hedgerows and the shepherds of the fruit harvest – the bumblebees.

      This drink appeared in our Ignis series of drinks that were inspired by the element of fire. Smoky, spicy and daring, these cocktails have walked across hot embers to get here, their components burnt or roasted to conjure the heat and drama of fire. The sherry contributes to the character imbued by the best ageing barrels. The barley tea provides another dimension: the grain that makes whisky so distinctive. Oleo saccharum is a technique of extracting citrus oil, mainly lemon, into sugar. Citrus rinds are mixed with a lot of sugar and left to stand to extract all the oils, resulting in a sweet, fruity syrup. It was used by nineteenth-century bartenders to give a drink citrus and sweetness. Our house-made Oleo Saccharum Citrus Sugar (page 243) is made with orange peel instead of lemon.

  - name: Caviar Martini
    notes: |+2
      Remember we said vodka accentuates any flavour it encounters? Well, caviar vodka is a niche spirit that has entered the spirits pantheon. It accentuates caviar’s ‘breath of the sea’ aroma with a richer palate than that of oysters coupled with hits of nuttiness and saltiness. Its high minerality complements the butteriness of lush Puligny-Montrachet wine that replaces the traditional vermouth element in a Martini. The pairing of these exquisite ingredients makes this a very elegant drink. We recommend an accompaniment of a small dish of Japanese wakame seaweed or sashimi, such as sea bream garnished with toasted nori. 
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 oz caviar vodka

    - Piece of pickled beetroot or a cocktail onion, to garnish

    notes: |+2
      It’s easy to get the Chatham Hotel Special mixed up with the Chatham Special. While the Chatham Cocktail’s true origins remain undiscovered at this time (sometimes attributed to the Chatham Hotel in New York), the libation of gin, ginger brandy and lemon appeared on Macy’s department store luncheon menus in 1913 and 1914 and today it remains an essential and influential if rare drink. But the Chatham Special was a horse of another colour, invented by Felix Cotto at the Chatham Hotel in Paris. He entered his creation in a 1950 ‘World Competition’ according to bartender-author Eddie Clark in his 1954 book King Cocktail: Shake Again with Eddie. Cotto’s Chatham Special was structured with rum, lemon juice and pineapple syrup; our Chatham Special has a similar profile but is made with profoundly Connaught Bar-style ingredients.

      A classic that sits alongside the Martini and the Manhattan, The Sidecar is a timeless creation with enigmatic origins, just like its siblings. This cognac, curaçao triple sec and lemon juice masterpiece appeared in two books in 1922: Robert Vermeire’s Cocktails: How to Mix Them and Harry MacElhone’s Harry’s ABC of Mixing Cocktails. Who was its creator? MacElhone claimed it was Malachi ‘Pat’ McGarry at the Buck’s Club. Vermeire said it was born at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes. Our twist on this simple masterpiece replaces the lemon juice with the high acidity of verjus. The drops of ginseng-bergamot bitters impart more complexity. If you cannot find ginseng-bergamot bitters, blend equal parts of a bergamot liqueur with a gentian liqueur. The touch of honey blended with equal parts of water to make it mixable imparts a sophisticated sweetness that makes our Cheek to Cheek a distinctive descendant.
    glassware: coupette
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 oz cognac
    - 1/2 oz curaçao triple sec

    - Drops of ginseng-bergamot bitters
    - "Garnish: Lemon twist"

      Relaxation is truly a state of mind, and chillies have been documented to offer us a way to achieve it. The secret to finding peace is simply to accept it – to chill out. In this Chill Out, the balance of sweet, citrus, spice and dilution is an essential structure for a non-alcoholic drink. Here, the orange and lemon are balanced by the syrup yet accentuated by the chilli, while the passion fruit brings softness and a distinctive taste of the tropics. It is the perfect drink when you want to chill out if you’re not drinking or wish to set a slower pace for the evening.

      When you say you are on ‘cloud nine’ you mean you are experiencing a feeling of well-being or elation. Essentially, this drink is a classic whiskey sour made with rich, sweet bourbon that is complemented with our house-made Pistachio and Raspberry Milk. Surprising notes of nuttiness and fruitiness balance against the Cocchi Americano infusion that highlights both the citrus and the brightness of the Szechuan pepper. Soft and approachable, this heaven-sent whiskey creation is topped with an ethereal foam made with Miraculous Foamer, a plant-based liquid used to replace egg white in a drink. You can use pasteurized egg white as an alternative, but you will need to dry shake the bourbon, milk and vermouth and then hard shake with ice. Either way you mix this creation, it is boundless joy in liquid form.

    ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 oz bourbon

    - Finally, spray blue spirulina liquid (a protein extracted from blue-green algae) over the top to make a cloud-like effect and use a spoon to create a spiral on the surface of the foam.

      Albert Stevens Crockett, historian of New York’s old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, noted in his 1934 book The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book that the Cooperstown cocktail was a ‘Bronx, with fresh mint’. Invented by the hotel’s bartender Johnny Solon, this refreshing blend of gin, fresh orange juice, mint and dashes of both red and dry vermouths inspired our icy, summery treat, which deepens the relationship between the ingredients with the introduction of port. Fashioning this classic into a julep drink enhances the Cooperstown Julep’s light and fruity character. It will make even the hottest day fly by on a fresh breeze.
    glassware: julep tin

There’s a hint of elegance and of the exotic from the use of Martini Riserva Speciale Ambrato, a floral and honey-laced vermouth di Torino, plus Sancerre wine from the Loire valley in France, which make an otherwise simple mix of rum, pineapple and coconut into a previously uncharted tropical destination.

The grating of tonka beans adds a warm hint of vanilla. As an option, a sprinkle of mahlab – a Mediterranean spice made from St Lucy’s cherry seeds – adds hints of cherry, rose, almond and vanilla.

      It is sunset. The light softens and the Connaught Bar is transformed. The Dusk is luminosity in a glass. Passion fruit and grapefruit notes are crowned by a delicate sunset, capturing the bar’s shift from day to evening – the magic hour when the bar springs to life. A very light, very approachable drink, The Dusk has a hint of a fernet-style amaro spiciness – a popular bitter aromatic Italian spirit served as a digestif. Passion berries are unrelated to passion fruit, yet they convey similar and complementary flavours and work beautifully together, and both match flawlessly with the buttery, grassy notes of the tequila. If you can’t get grapefruit and hops bitters, use grapefruit bitters instead.

      Throughout history, an eclipse has been regarded as a remarkable visual event that challenges and exhilarates the senses as the passage of one celestial body obscures the light of another in the sky. When a solar eclipse occurs, the sun is haloed by its own rays while its centre appears blackened out. When Giorgio and I collaborated on the presentation of this drink with our good friend, the photographer Alan Schaller, we wanted to emulate that experience. The result: a crystal tumbler that is white on the outside and glazed black on the inside. By obscuring the sipper’s sight of the liquid, their other senses are heightened, including imagination. The flavours of gin, vermouth, amaro and cocoa may seem familiar but the surprise hints of Japanese botanicals and ‘new make’ wine (a wine that comes from the first fermentation of grape juice and has not been aged after fermentation) transform this experience into a very special moment. Spice and wood notes predominate the profile with a light citrusy finish in this playful game that excites the senses just like an eclipse of the sun.

    notes: |+2
      The long and refreshing Faraway Collins was created in 2012 to encompass the familiar flavours and aromas of London and the faraway destinations of Japan, Australia and Mexico. It began its journey as a drink known simply as the Collins, which was invented in eighteenth-century London. The Collins was originally made with a spirit, such as gin or whisky, sugar, lemon juice and carbonated water (seltzer) – another invention that was introduced in the British capital during the 1790s. The Faraway Collins then heads eastward, stopping in Japan to meet the juice of the yuzu: a fruit that combines the strong citrus of lemon with the heady floral notes of wild mandarin oranges and a delicate lime blossom aroma. Journeying south to Australia, it acquires its aromatic sweetness from our housemade Eucalyptus Syrup, which imparts the cooling sensations of menthol, citrus and pine. Finally, this refreshing cocktail meets the intensely root beer-like qualities of Sarsaparilla-infused Soda Water, with its hints of wintergreen, liquorice, black cherry bark, sweet birch and cinnamon. When it returns homeward from its journey, the Faraway Collins offers a deep palate and even deeper texture to a refreshingly familiar English summertime classic. Besides being a perfect garden party drink, it pairs well with grilled (broiled) chicken skewers or a light fish, such as cod, Dover sole or sea bass.

      This elegant twist on a classic champagne cocktail was created in honour of Connaught hotel guest Princess Grace of Monaco. Named after the signature floral fragrance crafted for the princess’s 1956 wedding by perfumer James Henry Creed, the Fleurissimo has a special bouquet of floral notes, highlighted by violets. It is the subtle aroma of Parma violets – the distinctively aromatic, deep purple flowers used to make both a popular British sweet (candy) as well as crème de violette liqueur – that ennobles this cocktail. The first sip delivers a delicate surprise as notes of cherry, clove and nutmeg from the Peychaud’s Bitters complement the toasty, effervescence of the main attraction, the champagne. A soft, floral experience, the Fleurissimo is a regular feature on the Connaught Bar menu. It works well as an aperitif with a small dish of salty nibbles, such as nuts and crisps (potato chips), or as an overture to sushi.

      Love is a two-sided affair, one in which both parties share mutual affection and complementary characteristics. This pair of batched champagne cocktails is intended to be served together side by side in celebration of a lovely relationship. Float Like a Butterfly exhibits the complexity of a clarified milk punch made with a flowing stream of distinctive tastes from bourbon, tequila and absinthe, accentuated by vegetal, fruit and herbal notes from the celery, pineapple, fennel seeds, lemon zest, lemon verbena and fresh lemon juice. Sting Like a Bee offers a simpler statement: rich notes of chocolate and dried fruits mingled with fresh lemon juice and touches of floral sweetness from the bee pollen and sugar syrup. Both champagne cocktails complement the attributes of the other, allowing the sipper to appreciate the balance alone or shared with a loved one.

      According to ancient Iranian Christian teachings, the Garden of Eden’s real forbidden fruit was not the apple, it was the pomegranate. Here, we take a childhood classic – the Shirley Temple – and remake it for palates prepared to experience so much more. Our house-made Pomegranate Syrup is surprisingly simple to make and worlds better than the commercial versions. Together, this fusion of berries, cranberry and lemon juices and Pomegranate Syrup plays well with the ginger ale, providing a sparkling platform for the fresh berries.

      Giuseppe Maria Garibaldi was a nineteenth-century Italian who gained notoriety for his contribution to the unification of the Italian states. He was also instrumental in the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, along with the new nation’s first king, Victor Emmanuel II, and the revolutionary movement’s champion, Giuseppe Mazzini. A salute to this ‘father of the fatherland’, the Garibaldino unites a bright citrus palate with the floral notes of Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto, an Italian liqueur produced from rose petals and bergamot oranges. The sparkle from the white grape and apricot soda marries this palette of Italian flavours gathered from diverse regions of this bountiful country into a light, refreshing experience. In case you are unfamiliar with Savoia American Rosso Amaro Dolce, it is a bittersweet aperitif with notes of gentian and bitter orange.

      This fruit-driven nod to a classic Italian aperitif cocktail – the Spritz – is a logical evolution. Twentieth-century journalist Charles H. Baker documented the best drinks served around the world in his 1939 book The Gentleman’s Companion: Being an Exotic Drinking Book or, Around the World with Jigger, Beaker and Flask. At the Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong, he encountered a magnificent version of the Spritz. Thankfully, he documented it, leaving us the inspiration for this drink.

      ‘Give it the green light’ is a phrase that indicates a project has been given the go-ahead. And this drink commemorates the day we got the green light to open the Connaught Bar in its new vision. The green light came at the end of June 2008, when we set out to build our dream bar, bar team and drinks menu, and to attract our dream guests. Our dreams came true. Just like the Connaught Bar itself, there is far more to this drink than meets the eye. It is hard to define the sum of these elements. There are hints of Martini character, hints of Bloody Mary flavour and an herbaceous tone completed by the sharpness of the sorrel leaves. More than a twist on cocktail history, this drink was inspired by the art of mixology and the hotel management who celebrate the hotel’s bar culture as an oasis of culinary art.

      Drinks that promised to raise your spirits were popular during the 1930s, ’40s and beyond. In his 1948 book The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, David A. Embury challenged his readers to compare the Gloom Lifter with the Gloom Chaser and the Gloom Raiser. This twist on Embury’s Gloom Lifter – basically a classic cocktail called an egg sour made with Irish whiskey – adds some delightful fruit touches to a classic combination. The result is a crisp, dry, smoky drink with elegant raspberry and pomegranate notes that is light and deceptively strong.

    notes: |+2
      ‘As far as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster’ is a quote from the 1990 film Goodfellas that inspired Giorgio in 2015 to create a modern twist on the Fanciulli – a sweet Manhattan found in Albert Stevens Crockett’s 1934 book The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book. The drink was served as a frappé or straight up. While the original recipe added a fernet-style amaro – a popular bitter aromatic Italian spirit served as a digestif – to the traditional blend of whiskey and vermouth, Giorgio’s version highlights techniques and tastes that are essential to the modern mixological repertoire. Fresh cardamom leaves are infused into the bourbon and the pungent character of black cardamom is highlighted in our house-made syrup. The recent revival of Abbott’s Bitters offers the drink hints of tonka bean, peppermint, sweet cinnamon and warm spices. (But you can opt to use Angostura Bitters, if you prefer.) The deep notes of fig, molasses and cherry from the balsamic vinegar provide a finishing touch of mellow tartness. The hint of elicriso essence, extracted from Helichrysum orientale flowers, tops the bill with a floral note. If you can’t get this essence, sage and wormwood tincture will work just as well. As befits its name, the Good Fellas is a cheeky, lively take on a memorable classic cocktail.

      Shinrin yoku, the Japanese concept of ‘forest bathing’, is a simple method of finding tranquillity in natural spaces. Our Hidden Park conceals its special notes of Szechuan peppercorns in a breath of basil that heightens the gin’s cucumber and rose character. The floral character of the Riesling wine and the soft citrus notes of pink grapefruit open new horizons in your understanding of the complexity of the new gins and the cocktails that are made with them. The wakamomo, a pickled young peach from Japan, adds a finishing touch of slightly sweet and sour character to the ensemble.

      Only journalist-cum-globetrotter Charles H. Baker could unearth a champagne concoction at the home of a friend who lived in the French Concession of Shanghai, which he imported from Russia when the aristocracy took flight eastward in advance of revolutionary forces. Baker documented this rare find in his 1939 drinks travelogue The Gentleman’s Companion. The vision of a drink that he recounted conjures up images of beautifully regal Russian princesses with every sip and inspired this modern twist. It has a deep, complex character of genever, absinthe and drops of Abbott’s Bitters, accented with a fresh palate of elderflower liqueur and lemon juice. This updated version of a refreshingly frosty, luxurious crusta bears regal notes not just from its sweet, golden rim but from the rich aromas and tastes it grants with every sip.

      This cocktail was created at the request of the Bentley motor company in 2016 to serve as a non-alcoholic version of The Bentley Cocktail. The drink was made to be prepared in advance and served in the vehicle’s small bar. Flavours are some of our most enduring memories, some reaching back to childhood. We never stop making these reminiscences. Here, combining classic flavour memories in a new structure, we sought to create a pleasant new recollection. Refreshing and indulgent, the combination of our house-made Rhubarb and Red Fruits Cordial with the highest quality of organic cloudy apple juice and pink grapefruit soda creates a balance of tastes unlike any other.

      Juno was the Roman goddess of love and marriage. Her name has long been associated with the renewal – or rejuvenation – of the new moon. This gin creation evokes the quarter moon that shines on each Connaught Bar mirrored table. It also invites you to reflect on the half-moon shaped piece of white chocolate that graces this refreshingly light cocktail. The floral fresh notes of the cucumber and rose gin and jasmine tea are complemented by the herbaceous notes from the Acqua Bianca liqueur, a complex blend of lemon verbena, bergamot, peppermint, rose and a hint of ambergris. The mint soda and Cocoa Husk Cream marry these diverse flavours into a luscious veil of smoothness.

      Charles H. Baker, the renowned American journalist and cocktail aficionado, devoted his travels and time to documenting some of the finest sips he discovered as he globetrotted throughout the first half of the twentieth century. He waxed nostalgic with a ‘memory of the good days of 1915’ when he recalled the signature drink at New York’s Hotel Knickerbocker – the training ground for such famed barmen as Eddie Woelke, who went on to head Havana’s Sevilla-Biltmore bar, and Harry Craddock, who presided over London’s American Bar at the Savoy during the 1920s and ’30s. This twist on the hotel’s The Knickerbocker ‘Punch’ is reminiscent of those bygone days of sipping in one of the world’s great hotel bars. A delicate, dry yet creamy sip thanks to the inclusion of egg white, the aromas and tastes of Lime Sherbet and fragrant lemon verbena accentuate the Makrut Lime Leaf-infused Genever with its complex rye and barley notes. The champagne adds characteristic sparkle while the raspberry brings hits of fruitiness to this modern, frothy interpretation. It brings a smile to the face of anyone who encounters it.

      You may have experienced and loved many modern classics that fall under the drink category known as the Daisy – a sour cocktail sweetened with a liqueur or flavoured syrup. The Cosmopolitan, the Daiquirí and the Margarita (Spanish for ‘daisy’) are all Daisies. I crafted this Latina Daisy in 2008, to embrace the sensual experiences of Latin and Cuban culture – the colours, aromas, flavours and lifestyle. A classically crisp, fresh sour cocktail, it pairs dark chocolate liqueur with the crisp, fresh, lightly fruity character of white Cuban rum plus its distinctive notes of marzipan, citrus and allspice. This experience is heightened by the anise notes from the fennel seeds as well as the anise and vanilla dominant liqueur. Every sip of the Latina Daisy imparts a distinctive complexity, sophistication and richness to the palate. It can be served as an aperitif, digestif or simply as a delightful afternoon refreshment with a piece of rich, dark chocolate. My Latina Daisy was the winning creation at the 2009 Bacardí Legacy bartending competition.

    - 1 lime half, for moistening the rim of the glass
    - 1/3 oz Galliano l’Autentico
    - 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
    - 1-2 barspoons white caster (superfine) sugar
    - 2 barspoons fennel seeds
    - 1 3/4 oz white Cuban rum
    - 2/3 oz dark crème de cacao

    - Pour the Galliano l’Autentico into the coupette to give the drink a silky texture and clear appearance. 
    - Combine the lime juice, sugar and fennel seeds in a cocktail shaker and lightly muddle to dissolve the sugar and express the character of the fennel seeds. 
    - By mixing the sugar and lime juice in this way, you get a crisper texture and flavour. 
    - Add the rum and crème de cacao and some ice cubes to the shaker, then shake and double strain into the prepared coupette.

This dark version of the French 75 conceals a hidden secret: the Swiss lemon crème palate camouflaged in this charcoal black, effervescent concoction.

The tequila takes on a remarkable rich softness after spending a night with the peanut and almond butters. The Clarified Vanilla Milk adds creaminess without compromising clarity. Combined with the deep aromas of barrel-aged Armagnac and the toasty effervescence of champagne, this libation transports you into new dimensions in the cocktail universe.

      He may have never written a cocktail book, but Basil Woon immortalized the Mary Pickford cocktail in his 1928 travelogue When It’s Cocktail Time in Cuba, when he noted that Liverpudlian bartender Fred Kaufman was ‘the inventor of many cocktails in which pineapple juice is the chief ingredient’. Kaufman’s most enduring creation – a cocktail made with rum, pineapple juice and grenadine – was crafted for silent-screen star Mary Pickford when she stayed at Havana’s Hotel Nacional. The drink embodies simplicity. We decided to make this enduring cocktail more sophisticated by infusing aged whisky with roasted pineapple and enhancing it with the rich, luscious flavours of cocoa, an herbaceous amaro and maraschino liqueur. The mint leaves add a touch of freshness to a cocktail bouquet that deserves deference and respect.
    glassware: julep tin
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/3 oz Roasted Pineapple-infused Aged Blended Scotch

    - 1 barspoon maraschino liqueur
    - 6 mint leaves

      They say opposites attract. In the Magnetum, art and science collide to create a visually striking drink. The clear liquid in the bottom represents the outside of the Connaught Bar and the dark brown liquid layered on top represents the venue’s interior. Using a bespoke ice lift that reduces dilution while it elevates the piece of block ice in the drink, the liquids are married together, blending tradition and innovation, form and flavour into a single statement. The patterned base of the ice lift offers an additional visual element to savour as you sip. The bottom layer is a clarified whisky milk punch featuring fresh pineapple and fino sherry with hints of fennel and lemon verbena. The top layer is single malt whisky and a Pedro Ximénez sherry. When the two layers merge as one, they create a rich, fruity sip with warm undertones of walnuts, wood smoke and crème brûlée. This is a deep sip to be shared over a long conversation, a dish of nuts, dried fruits and a piece of Manchego or other sheep’s milk cheese. We created the bespoke ice lift tool to lift a piece of block ice inside an old fashioned glass, but a barspoon can be used to blend the liquids together.

    ingredients:
    - 2 1/2 oz Magnetum Milk Punch

    notes: |+2
      Journalist-cum-globetrotter Charles H. Baker’s love of Mint Juleps fills a staggering eight pages in his 1939 drinks travelogue The Gentleman’s Companion. He began by citing the concoction’s ancient Persian origins before extolling the joys of Kentucky Mint Juleps. Baker then continued his homage by presenting eight formulas he encountered in the Philippines, Cuba, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and Maryland. It was bartender Monk Antrim’s Manila Hotel Mint Julep No. 1 that captured our attention, combining bourbon and rum with pineapple as a tropical touch. This twist on Baker’s discovery introduces the lightly spiced and bittersweet notes of Amaro Braulio, an Italian amaro with deep flavours of clove, dried fruits, cola, liquorice and bitter bark, in addition to the marriage of cognac and rum from the Dominican Republic. The complexity of this refresher is enhanced, like its predecessor, with pineapple notes as well as a traditional signature of fresh mint leaves.

      My Fair Lady (1964)

      A twist on the Mayfair Cocktail, which Robert Vermeire invented and featured in his 1922 book Cocktails: How to Mix Them, our Mayfair Lady was inspired by a gregarious waitress who previously worked in the Connaught Bar. A tequila-based cocktail, it embodies the spice-forward profile of the original, which included dashes of both apricot and clove syrups, by infusing the spices into Sancerre wine and accentuating the aroma with elderflower liqueur. With her new-found flavour language, our Mayfair Lady ventures out into new and far more refined territory.

      This clean, crisp thirst quencher harkens back to fresh, fragrant breezes and lazy, sunny days on the Mediterranean. This refreshing highball features the slightly piney flavour and aroma of mastiha, a Greek liqueur made from the resin of the mastic tree, a small evergreen that is native to the Mediterranean. Scents of bergamot, basil and mastiha waft in the air and on the palate. A delicate bite of aromatic spice from the angel hair chilli – dried and shredded Chinese long chillies that impart a citrusy flavour – brightens the experience without adding too much heat.

      The Memento is an updated version of a Connaught Bar classic, Set in Stone. It is also a modernized twist on a cocktail classic, the Martinez. While the latter blends gin, sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur with a dash of bitters, our version marries cucumber and rose gin with genever to add more complexity to the foundation botanical mixture. In a similar vein, the warmth of sherry is paired with dry vermouth to establish a richer tone than its ancestor. In the same way we contributed stone to the Set in Stone presentation, we sous-vide the Memento Mix with a piece of white marble and heat it to impart a touch of chalk and dry sweet to the finished drink. The piece of stone paper (a paper made from discarded stone), spray of elicriso essence, extracted from Helichrysum orientale flowers, and a wakamomo – pickled young peach from Japan – add the finishing touches of slightly herbal, sweet and sour pickle character to the presentation.

      The Mayfair Cocktail, named after one of London’s most aristocratic neighbourhoods, made its way around Europe at the height of Prohibition in the United States. Robert Vermiere, in his 1922 book Cocktails: How to Mix Them, claims he created the recipe while working at the Embassy Club in London in 1921. Harry Cradddock added a touch of spice to his version, which appeared in his 1930 compilation The Savoy Cocktail Book. 
      
      Our My Fair tips a glass not only to this cocktail classic but also to the district in which the Connaught resides. We’ve added a sparkle to our presentation with a touch of champagne, which accentuates the aromas and flavours of our house-made Spiced Calamansi Sherbet and Apricot Velvet that make My Fair a special tribute of our own.

      No matter where you wander, there is a certain mystique to a walk in the woods. It’s no wonder forests and woodlands are ideal locations for those who seek tranquility, and even a hint of mystery. The intensity of the sweet earthy notes of the Beetroot and Blackberry Cordial in our Mysterious Woodlands is calmed by the introduction of cocoa and citrus notes. The aroma of the spinach and lemon thyme powder touches your senses with a profusion of matcha-like notes that make you feel like you are walking in the woods.

      Presented in 2019 for the one-hundredth anniversary of the Negroni, with Connaught Gin, the Negroni 10–100 was actually born in 2018 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Connaught Bar. The drink was originally layered in the glass and mixed by the guest. Each element in the drink has a big personality. This twist on the Negroni uses rare botanicals, a new blend of a floral and honey-laced vermouth di Torino – Martini Riserva Speciale Ambrato – and rediscovered vintage flavours. Considered a simple drink throughout the first century of its life, the Negroni’s cardinal structure, balancing strength, bitter, sweet and spice, is a perfect springboard for flavour exploration. After extensive experimentation we landed on this lush and luxurious interpretation of Italy’s most iconic aperitif. The hint of Bordeaux wine adds a new dimension.

    notes: |+2
      Nearly a century after its debut in Harry Craddock’s 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book, the Abbey Cocktail is still a tried-and-true classic mix of gin, Lillet, orange juice and Angostura Bitters. It also proves to be an ideal stepping stone for the creation of a new drink. Thus, we gave it the name The New Abbey in tribute to its inspiration. We have no doubt Harry Craddock would have loved the broad spectrum of flavours and techniques available to modern bartenders. While fat-washing exploded onto the bar scene in the early 2000s, it has never delivered better taste than with cocoa butter and coconut oil. And green mandarin essence? It has become as indispensable as Angostura Bitters. These days, we can evoke any season through essences and bitters, as well as capturing flavours through fat-washing our spirits.

    notes: |+2
      Number 11 was created in 2019 to celebrate the Connaught Bar’s eleventh anniversary. A tribute and an evolution of The Connaught Martini our bar’s signature offering, it was also inspired by another cocktail classic, The Vesper. While the Number 11 only contains four ingredients, there are two elements that make this version a special occasion, a visual celebration. First, the cocktail glass is hand painted with splashes of edible art paint in a style reminiscent of the famed twentieth-century Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock. The four colours we use represent the drink’s four main ingredients: gin, vodka, vermouth and bitters. (The drink also adopts Pollock’s technique for naming his works by number.) Second, the drink is aerated in the same way Spanish cider is served, using an escanciador, a battery-operated Spanish cider-pouring device that injects air into the drink by just pouring the liquid from a great height. (The same aeration can be accomplished by throwing the drink, just like they do in Barcelona.) To craft this new classic, gin, vodka and our house-made Amalfi Lemon Peel-infused Vermouth are batched in a bottle and stored in the freezer. 
      
      The quantities below are for an individual Number 11, but we recommend making ten portions – 450 ml (15 fl oz) gin, 300 ml (10 fl oz) vodka and 150 ml (5 fl oz) vermouth – so you have more than one serving in the bottle. To serve, the frozen bottle is attached to the escanciador and dispensed into the hand-painted cocktail glass. A delicate rose-like fragrance is imparted to the presentation when a few dashes of bitters distilled from the same five aromatic bitters that are also offered with The Connaught Martini (ginseng-bergamot, lavender, tonka bean, coriander and cardamom) are dropped on the top. The resulting delicate, aromatic notes of citrus and spice are guaranteed to excite to the senses.

    - 1-2 dashes five bitters distillate (or you can substitute orange flower water)
    steps:

    - Pour the gin, vodka and vermouth into a sterilized bottle. 
    - Freeze the bottle until ready to serve. 
    - Attach the frozen bottle to an escanciador. 
    - Turn it on and dispense the drink into the decorated cocktail glass with a piece of shaped ice.

      As the last letter of the Greek alphabet, omega has traditionally symbolized a sense of comprehensiveness – of being all that you can be, of being perfect to the end. In modern times, to be an omega person is the opposite of an alpha. Instead of being confident, bold, the first in everything, as an omega you are completely your own person regardless of others’ expectations. This Omega is a clear, citrusy take on a Margarita with softer, more complex notes than its bold predecessor. The lightly aged tequila couples well with our house-made Soft Lime Juice and mandarin orange bitters, resulting in a sophisticated interpretation. The coriander bitters add a familiar herbal freshness that is characteristic of fine Mexican cuisine.

  - name: Oops I Dropped an Olive
    notes: |+2
      This cocktail is dedicated to Italian restaurateur and Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura, who created his signature dish Oops I Dropped the Lemon Tart after one of his staff dropped a lemon tart. Sometimes when you make a mistake you discover something new. One Christmas when Giorgio was a barback (assistant to the bartender), he added some pine needles to a bottle of gin and left them to infuse overnight to enhance the juniper, but instead found an olive oil character structure similar to the Martini. He was able to fool famous palates from across Italy with this faux olive oil flavour. Massimo even tried it at the bar and loved it. This drink has deep texture and a heady aromatic atmosphere. A day-long infusion of pine needles with the gin lends a surprising aroma of extra virgin olive oil. The Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto – an Italian liqueur produced from rose petals and bergamot oranges – marries well with vibrant vanilla notes of the Galliano l’Autentico as well as the bitter character of Mediterranean citruses (including chinotto, bergamot, orange, tangerine and grapefruit), juniper, cardamom, lavender and other spices found in the Galliano l’Aperitivo. Garnished with a green olive, the Italian heritage and humour of this Martini-like cocktail will make you smile.

      Chance encounters can yield delightful results! The Connaught Bar hosted a week-long ‘jam’ session in 2014, featuring head bartender Colin Field of the Bar Hemingway in the Ritz Paris Hotel and myself. The Pearendipity is one of the outcomes of our improvised collaboration. While Field’s classic Serendipity highlights a marriage of apple juice, Calvados and champagne, this special blend serves up the fun of a Mojito with the sophistication of a champagne cocktail. Crisp, tangy pear meets the tropical influence of the deep, fruity character of dark Cuban rum with its distinctive notes of vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and aged wood. This spirituous blend is also complemented with the zesty, citrusy notes of the Lime Sherbet (page 242). Perfumed with the aroma of fresh mint, the Pearendipity delivers a refreshing sip that works with as an aperitif, a refreshing summer drink or as an accompaniment with roasted pork.

      Primo means ‘first’ in Italian. This drink was inspired by our beautiful pewter-trimmed marble bar top; both powerful and elegant. When you enter, the bar draws your eyes, and it is the first thing you see. The Primo goes far beyond a single note, playing a major chord of spices and classic bitter notes in perfect pitch and harmony. Inspired by the aromas and flavours of Amazonia, the Muyu Chinotto Nero Liqueur introduces cinchona, oak moss, sweet oranges and the bitter chinotto oranges to the mix. The Rubino Vermouth, which revives and enhances a 150-year old vermouth di Torino recipe with rare sandalwood and three types of wormwood, adds complexity. While the rum provides depth, the coconut milk brings a hint of velvet to the mix.

      Creativity may start with a single drop. But truly creative expressions make ripples in the fabric of peoples’ hearts and minds. What makes this drink cause ripples to the senses is the pairing of our house-made Chicha Morada – a South American beverage made with Peruvian purple corn, apples and key limes with hints of cinnamon and clove – and Everleaf Forest, a non-alcoholic aperitif that features woodland botanicals mingled with saffron, vanilla and orange blossom. This intricate fabric of flavours and aromas is trimmed with bright notes of citrus, peach, jasmine and vanilla that cause waves of flavour that capture your imagination with every sip.

  - name: Ristretto Manhattan
    notes: |+2
      An iconic drink, the Manhattan is a member of the holy trinity of classic cocktails that includes the Martini and the Daiquirí. While this classic is frequently made with either bourbon or rye whiskey, the inclusion of Italian red vermouth is too sweet for some palates. I created this elegant, grown-up version of a classic Manhattan when I worked at Montgomery Place off Portobello Road in London. I translated the elements of a Manhattan, using bourbon and Punt e Mes vermouth – an aperitif wine whose name literally translates to ‘one point’ sweetness and a ‘half point’ bitterness. The first twist comes from the flavour of a traditional Italian pick-me-up – a ristretto or short shot of espresso – from the coffee liqueur. The second twist is the hint of blackberry fruitiness from the crème de mûre. Like the classic Manhattan, my Ristretto Manhattan announces the end of the workday with distinctive flavours that also work as an accompaniment to a mixed grill or a perfectly executed steak.
    glassware: red wine glass
    ingredients:
    - 11/2 oz bourbon
    - 2/3 oz Punt e Mes vermouth
    - 1/3 oz dry coffee liqueur
    - 1 barspoon crème de mûre
    - 2 dashes Abbott’s Bitters or Angostura Bitters
    - Spray of orange essence
    - "Garnish: 1 fresh blackberry"
    steps:
    - Combine the bourbon, vermouth, coffee liqueur, crème de mûre and bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled. 
    - Strain into a red wine glass fitted with an ice sphere. 
    - Spray orange essence over the top and garnish with a fresh blackberry tied onto a stirring stick and suspended over the edge of the glass.

      Why did we name this drink the Royal Seal? To quote the British style publication, Tatler: ‘Named after Queen Victoria’s seventh child Arthur, later Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the Connaught occupies the most majestic spot in Mayfair,… it remains a royal favourite, from the Queen Mother who opened the hotel’s new kitchen to its glorious restaurant the Connaught Grill, a restaurant loved by Princess Diana, who would regularly lunch there with her stepmother Countess Raine.’ This cocktail is our personal toast to the hotel’s royal history and the recognition it has garnered over its long history. It is a drink that is alive with tropical fruits that sing with flavour hints of mango, apricot and coffee.

      A modern classic that follows the same simple pattern as the Martini with gin, the Manhattan with rye and the Sidecar with cognac, the Margarita is the epitome of a tequila cocktail, combining spirit with lime and triple sec. Our Sandia, which means ‘watermelon’ in Spanish, is a refreshing twist on this cocktail masterpiece. We introduced a Watermelon and Tomato Stalk Shrub to our version for complexity. Then we spiced the mixture with Ancho Reyes Chile Liqueur made from poblano chillies and pineapple. And we added a touch of Amaro Santoni, made with thirty-four botanicals, which imparts a long bittersweet aroma of clove and piney freshness.

    notes: |+2
      The Scented Cup is a successor to the Corpse Reviver No. 2, a classic created by Harry Craddock when he presided over the American Bar at the Savoy during the 1920s. Here, we replace the lemon juice with dry sherry and infuse the Lillet with floral, earthy saffron for a gentler and far more refined ‘reviver’. The cucamelon, a diminutive member of the cucumber family native to Central and South America, contributes hints of sweet cucumber and subtle citrus. The signature dash of absinthe is what makes The Scented Cup a true descendant of Craddock’s famed Corpse Reviver family.

      There are many portions of our lives that are malleable like sculptor’s clay. There are others that evoke a sense of permanency and from that foundation one can find strength and structure, a place where one can find identity. Set in Stone brings together classic flavours and aromas that are part of the foundation of many familiar cocktails. Gin and genever both offer that sense of tradition and permanency. This solid structure is complemented by other classic ingredients from the cocktail repertoire – rich, luscious sherry plus a waft of bergamot rosolio – plus the aroma of elicriso essence, extracted from Helichrysum orientale flowers. Minerality is introduced into the mixture with the stone paper garnish (a paper made from discarded stone), reminding you that the love of a fine cocktail is an element in life that is set in stone.

  - name: Singapore Swizzle
    notes: |+2
      A quick, efficient tool for giving a drink lift while it diminishes the sparkle of the soda, the original swizzle stick was born during the eighteenth century in the West Indies. Fashioned from a branch of the Quararibea tubinata, or ‘swizzle stick’ tree, this device lent its name to a whole category of drinks that follow this tried-and-true method for mixing. Singapore is the traditional birthplace of the Straits Sling and its fruity modern descendant the Singapore Sling. Our creation combines the best features of this East Indies recipe blended with a West Indies mixing technique. And the herbaceous touch of Bénédictine (a French liqueur made with twenty-seven berries, flowers, herbs and spices) along with ratafia (a similar Italian liqueur made with stone fruit kernels, spices and citrus peel) make for a herbal, spicy and fruity blend highlighted by the tropical freshness of coconut soda that takes this drink far beyond the Singapore Sling to a grown-up, sophisticated level. To make the garnish, we made an ice cup and then crushed it and used an ice stamp to add our design, then added coconut flakes on the top.
    glassware: pilsner
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 oz London dry gin
    - 1/3 oz Bénédictine
    - 1/3 oz ratafia
    - 1 1/2 oz fresh pineapple juice
    - 1 barspoon Pomegranate Syrup

    steps:
    - Combine the gin, Bénédictine, ratafia, pineapple juice, syrup and bitters in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously until the drink is sufficiently chilled. 
    - Strain into a pilsner glass and slowly add the coconut soda and more crushed ice. 
    - Lift the drink.

      Unrelated to the tabloid newspaper with a similar name, The Sun of London is a nod to the Connaught Bar’s heritage and the Italian master mixologists who presided behind the bar.

It’s always sunny in Italy, but in London those halcyon days have always been cause for celebration, especially for Italian bartenders braving the grey to make drinks in the world’s best city for cocktail culture and bringing their own sunshine with them in their creations.

      This drink is named after two of our most regular guests. Originally from Milan, Mr Sweet works in the cinema industry, travelling the globe throughout the year. He typically orders a dry Martini, Negroni or Margarita. Mr Z works in the pharmaceutical industry, commuting regularly from Milan to London. He likes fruity, lighter drinks, like a Cosmopolitan, or creamier cocktails, such as Grasshoppers and Brandy Alexanders. Friends for nearly twenty years, the only time they get to meet and catch up is at our bar. Even visually, they are like night and day. So, we decided to make a drink that honours them both: it is an herbaceous, chocolaty concoction that satisfies people with both types of palates. Combining the strong herbal traits of a Negroni, made with tequila, bitter aperitif and vermouth, with a Golden Cadillac, crafted from a vanilla-based Italian liqueur, cacao nibs and cream, this clarified milk punch makes the perfect party drink since it can be batched, chilled over ice and finished with a light spray of essential oil and a piece of chocolate.

  - name: Vieux Connaught
    notes: |+2
      A delicate waft of saffron smoke caresses the rich flavours of rum and rye whiskey in the Vieux Connaught. Inspired by the signature Vieux Carré cocktail created in 1938 by head bartender Walter Bergeron at the Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans, the Vieux Connaught offers a balanced, modern experience. A buttery sweet Guatemalan rum instead of the vanilla and stone fruit character of cognac pairs with the spicy, peppery rye whiskey, softening the woody notes of the spirits. (If you cannot find a Guatemalan rum, you can try a Venezuelan or other solera-style aged Spanish rum.) The flavour is enhanced by silky, honeyed notes, cardamom, nutmeg, cedarwood, sage and citrus peel from the Bénédictine liqueur and it complements the dry, light mineral accents of the Connaught’s proprietary dry vermouth. Instead of the intense spiciness from anise, cinnamon, cloves, cherry, plum and blackcurrants found in Peychaud’s Bitters, citrusy edges are introduced with dashes of Angostura and orange bitters. The mixture is built and poured into a glass decanter. Next, we smoke the drink by placing a pinch of saffron into a smoking gun and injecting the smoke directly into the decanter. Served on a mirrored tray, the customer can glimpse a rare sight – the bar’s elegantly carved ceiling – as the Vieux Connaught is poured from the bottle into a chilled old fashioned glass. The smokiness is controlled to taste by leaving the drink in the smoked decanter for longer if desired. It is an ideal digestif and an excellent accompaniment with smoked salmon, smoked trout or a creamy cheese.

    ingredients:
    - 1 oz aged Guatemalan rum

    - Smoke the contents with a pinch of saffron placed into a smoking gun. 
    - Inject the smoke directly into the decanter and seal to retain the smoke. 
    - To serve, pour about half the drink into an old fashioned glass filled with a piece of block ice and garnish with a z-shaped orange twist. 
    - If you do not have a smoking gun, place a pinch of saffron threads on a heatproof plate. 
    - Light the threads with a small torch next to the drink-filled old fashioned glass. 
    - Immediately place a glass bowl or cloche over the drink and wait for a few moments. 
    - Uncover, add a piece of block ice and serve.

      This cocktail is named after the Ukrainian mathematician Georgy Voronoi, who devised the elegant Voronoi diagram that partitions a two-dimensional Euclidean plane into regions, each of a given set of objects. The light floral notes of the tequila, mescal and Lime Sherbet contrast yet unite with the earthy, balsamic aromas of the vetiver liqueur, which is made from the vetiver grass, native to India. A subtle touch of nutmeg emanates from the vermouth infused with mace blades – the sister spice of the nutmeg tree. Together these ingredients present a delicate interpretation of how seemingly different elements unite, even though they are not symmetrical.

      Before there was a non-alcoholic vermouth on the market, we removed the alcohol of the ambrato vermouth with the help of heat from a Thermomix® to create our own non-alcoholic drink. It was our first non-alcoholic drink to make the masterpieces section of our menu. It is a drink of surprises, as the chillies distilled with the vermouth offer flavour but none of the heat, recreating the sensation of alcohol.

      A drink inspired by the element of wood, this libation takes its cue from the silver and gold tones of the Connaught Bar’s wood panelling. Sometimes the greatest inspiration is right before your eyes. In this case, the depth of warm brown tones in the Connaught Bar’s wood panelling gave birth to this wonderfully spicy and complex aperitif. Wild cherry bark and catuaba bark convey the message beautifully among the dark, aged spirit and coffee flavours joining together into a deep, warming statement. The grapefruit and rosemary tonic water brings the portrait to life with a zesty sparkle.

      Born and raised in Italy, I acquired a passion for the Negroni early in my drinking life. This Italian classic combines herbaceous and bitter notes and is traditionally served during aperitivo – a moment at the end of the workday when conversation and a small bite go hand in hand with this classic refreshment. I created the Yellow Submarine when I first arrived in London in 2006 as the head bartender at Montgomery Place – a bar off Portobello Road. This twist on the Negroni is served like its predecessor, on the rocks, but I use an ice ball instead of cubes. In my version, gin is accentuated by the minerality of sherry, the smooth floral notes of lavender with hints of sweetness from vanilla and anise. Why did I name this drink after a famous song performed by The Beatles? Since I serve this drink on the rocks just like a Negroni, the ice ball, which keeps the drink icy cold, reminds me of a porthole on a submarine. And the drink’s pale-yellow hue made it a natural fit to its pop culture name.
