      "“This is by far my favorite cocktail I've ever written, and it was very selfishly made for my personal taste. I moved to Colorado from South Florida, and I wanted to write an old-fashioned variation that reminded me of home. The cold brew and banana liqueur were inspired by Cuban coffee and sweet plantains, and they both pair really well with Ron Zacapa.This drink is perfect to make at home, because it's actually written as a Freezer Bar pour. Normally when you stir a cocktail, the dilution from the melted ice is part of what balances the drink. For the Wizard, we measured out how much water we were getting from ice, then used cold brew instead of water for the dilution—almost like you're stirring the drink over frozen coffee ice cubes. The best way to make this drink is to batch a whole bottle to keep in your freezer, then just pour some over ice whenever you want a drink.” —JP"
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1½ ounces Ron Zacapa 23 Solera rum

    - ½ teaspoon Demerara Syrup
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - 2 dashes (or 20 drops) Salt Solution

      "This drink lands in my top five most-unconventional cocktails that I've developed. My intention was to create a drink utilizing ingredients grown in Mexico that are evocative of the terroir where mezcal is produced: cooked agave, bitter fruit (rhubarb) and orchard fruit (apple). The result is a bittersweet, somewhat morbidly named, apple- and rhubarb-flavored Negroni riff utilizing two uncommon bitters. Cardamaro (cardoon amaro) is a wine-based amaro that replaces the traditional sweet vermouth, while Amaro Zucca (rhubarb) stands in for Campari. Cyril Zangs' amazing apple cider eau-de-vie adds a nice juicy bite to the cocktail, and Del Maguey Chichicapa mezcal offers tropical notes and a smoky finish. It's cocktails like this that inspire me to keep pushing boundaries."
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Del Amigo mezcal
    - ¼ ounce Del Maguey Chichicapa mezcal
    - ¼ ounce Cyril Zangs 00 apple cider eau-de-vie
    - ¾ ounce Cardamaro
    - ½ ounce Amaro Zucca
    - "Garnish: 1 apple fan"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients over ice, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. 
    - Garnish with the apple fan.

      This variation on Sam Ross's iconic Penicillin cocktail splits the modern classic's base spirit (blended scotch) with a funky Jamaican rum and adds a touch of créme de cacao to round out the spicy ginger syrup. In addition to adding aromatics to the drink, the garnish uses two bitters, styled in a “W” as a nod to the cocktail's namesake RV.
    glassware: coupe
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Arran 10-year single malt Scotch
    - 1 ounce Appleton 15-year Jamaican rum
    - Scant ½ ounce ginger syrup
    - Scant ½ ounce honey syrup
    - 1 teaspoon Giffard white créme de cacao
    - 1 egg white
    - "Garnish: Bittermens Xocolatl mole bitters and Angostura bitters"
    steps:
    - Dry shake all the ingredients, then shake again with ice. 
    - Double strain into a coupe. 
    - Dash the top of the drink with two parallel lines of bitters, then draw the tip of a toothpick across the lines to make a “W” shape.

      For this white negroni variation, Death & Co LA's Edwin Rios wanted to combine the flavors of various corn-based dishes—including esquites, masa, champurado, and atole—that he grew up with while reimagining the flavors or huitlacoche, the tasty fungus that grows on corn cobs. The drink's bright, unmistakably corn-y flavor comes from Nixta Licor de Elote, a complex, sweet-savory liqueur made with a combination of raw, roasted, and nixtamalized corn. After many rounds of iteration—the drink was originally a boulevardier riff using bourbon, amaro, and Nixta—Edwin landed on the marriage of reposado tequila, Salers Gentian Apéritif, and a touch of mezcal, with a dash of spice-forward Moroccan bitters to bind all of the flavors together.
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Cimarron reposado tequila
    - ¾ ounce Salers Gentian Apéritif
    - ¾ ounce Nixta Licor de Elote
    - ½ ounce Legendario Domingo Guerrero Mezcal
    - 1 dash Bitter End Moroccan Bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube.

      "The flavor of this cocktail was very much inspired by tasting Empirical Spirits habanero spirit (also known as “F*ck Trump and his Stupid F*cking Wall”). It's a pretty interesting expression of habanero because the heat doesn't survive the distillation process, so all you're left with is this intense, floral fruitiness that you don't normally notice in habaneros (because your mouth is too busy getting scorched by the capsaicin). Anyway, not too long after tasting that spirit I had the idea of habanero + peaches + bourbon in an old-fashioned template. I think I wrote the original spec down in 2019 or 2020, but it didn't really line up with what we needed on our menu until 2021. The drink basically wrote itself after that; I think I tried one or two configurations before I found one that I liked: high-proof bourbon for structure, a little mezcal for some smoke (and because it made it a no-brainer order for our guests), and the combo of habanero spirit and crème de pêche bringing fruit but also a weird savory acidity. It was a top seller on that menu."
    glassware: double rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Stellum x Death & Co Dark Matter Bourbon (This special bourbon was a collaboration between us and Stellum Spirits. Any high-rye, (ideally) cask-strength bourbon will make a good substitute.)
    - ¾ ounce Empirical Spirits Habanero
    - ¼ ounce Mal Bien mezcal
    - ½ teaspoon Giffard Crème de Pêche
    - 1 teaspoon Cane Sugar Syrup (2:1 cane sugar to water)
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 dash Bittermens Hopped Grapefruit Bitters
    - "Garnish: 1 lemon coin"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a single old-fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. 
    - Express the lemon coin over the drink, then place it in the drink.

      "This drink was based on a past cocktail that my friend Edder Garcia and I worked on in 2018 at a bar called Sonny's Hideaway. Together, we came up with the concept of combining carrot and coconut which unmistakably tastes like one of my favorite desserts: carrot cake! For the Tunnel Vision, I took that same concept and applied it towards a take on a piña colada. As the base spirit, Linie Aquavit lends its profile of caraway, anise, and vanilla to match with the earthiness of the carrot, and just a quarter ounce of Reisetbauer Carrot eau de vie can go a long way to ensure the carrot doesn't get lost in the mix. It wouldn't feel right to make a piña colada without a little bit of rum, so Probitas blended white rum ensures that it ties back to the classic. Lastly, a touch of acidity from lemon juice is the key to balancing the cocktail's structure. The drink's name is a play on how carrots are (supposedly) good for your vision."

    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Linie Aquavit
    - ½ ounce Probitas blended white rum

      "The Majin Buu came out of repeated requests for a bitter, herbal, gin-based drink at the bar. Working off the Mai Tai template, I chose navy-strength Four Pillars gin for its bright citrus tones and proofiness, while the Amaro Meletti brings in some chocolate and cola notes. Donn's Mix is simply grapefruit juice and cinnamon syrup, which brings some bittersweet notes that play nicely with the citrus and chocolate-cola profile. The drink's name comes from the Dragon Ball manga series: Maijin Buu is a pink genie who transforms living things into chocolate, then eats them."

      “My goal with this drink was to create a savory Negroni by skipping the typical orange and grapefruit citrus pops that can become a crutch when creating bitter, stirred aperitivos. The flavors are centered around the idea of an olive brine with the Olive Leaf gin, fennel from the Finocchietto and balsam fir and rosemary notes from the Bruto Americano. All combining to make a herbaceous, savory and unexpected Negroni variation.” —TE

      "Tyson Buhler, Death & Co's National Director of Food & Beverage, created this to celebrate the launch of our collaboration with Art of Tea: Fleur Noire, a rose- and apple-enhanced Pu-erh blend. Delivering the flavors of this soul-warming tea to a cocktail takes a couple of simple preparatory steps: first, you make a syrup from steeped tea and sugar, then add a trio of acids to convert the syrup into a cordial. Equal parts cordial and apple brandy, lengthened with cold seltzer (please chill your seltzer!) results in a complex, refreshing, sweater-season-appropriate highball."

    steps:
    - Combine all of the ingredients except the seltzer in a collins glass, then fill the glass with ice cubes.

      “There was a tropical drink on our previous menu that featured aquavit and Jamaican rum, and I enjoyed that pairing. I wanted to create some sort of Negroni variation and figured it would work because of the popularity of Joaquin Simo's Kingston Negroni and the affinity between Jamaican rum and aquavit. But the drink needed another hook. I always enjoyed peanut butter on rye bread, with the nuttiness and caraway being a good dynamic, so I fat-washed the aquavit with peanut butter. Once the drink was spec'd out it just needed something to make the flavors pop, and a bit of banana liqueur did the trick. As far as the name goes, I was into playing LCD Soundsystem at the bar a lot and this song title felt like a fun name for a cocktail. Its ingredients were a little bit out there, and sometimes a good name can help sell a drink that people might otherwise be unsure of based on the ingredients alone.” -JW

      "The inspiration for this drink came to me when I was watching 'Roadrunner,' the Anthony Bourdain biopic. In the movie, there's a clip of his very first episode of his early travel show. While visiting Japan, Tony refers to himself as a 'lost and hungry ghost,' which set the stage for the rest of the drink. Each element was chosen to represent his legacy and career in a respectful way, as a sort of tribute cocktail. The base is blended Japanese whisky (a nod to where it all started) along with Laird's apple brandy (both Bourdain and Laird's are from New Jersey), with a touch of peaty Islay whisky (because he very publicly loved a good smoke). And the honey, herbal génépy liqueur and absinthe rinse all point to the French influence that Tony carried through his early days as a chef and in his later days, when he spent much of his time in France. This Sazerac riff definitely has the most convoluted story of anything I've created, but the end result comes together perfectly. —DA"

      "This cocktail came from trying to meet a deadline and my friend and 'work dad' Scott Key (a manager at Death & Co Denver) helping me into the wee hours of the morning with the drink development. My assignment was to make a simple, spirituous after-dinner drink. Scott grabbed two favorite after-dinner nips (Bénédictine and Grand Marnier), I love the former with brandy as a nightcap, as does my biological father. Apple brandy—both the robust juiciness of Laird's and the floral, more nuanced Calvados—bridged the two liqueurs together perfectly, with mole bitters coming in with some complex spice notes. It was 7am and our morning kitchen staff was arriving by the time we finished, but we had a blast and my drink was green-lit on the first try, which made us both proud—and extremely hungover. -EF"

      "This Mexican-inspired Sazerac is one of my favorite drinks that I’ve created. The idea was first sparked by chef Juan Catalan Moreno when he made me my first champurrado, a Mexican hot-chocolate drink thickened with masa harina and flavored with cinnamon, anise, and other spices. I’m a small-town Iowa boy, so this delicious drink knocked my socks off. The anise element sent me to try an absinthe-laced sazerac variation, and I attempted to harness the other flavors with the powerhouse combo of corn liqueur and cacao nib-infused rum. Nixta Licor de Elota is made with ancestral varieties of corn that are nixtamalized in the same fashion as masa, and Copalli Cacao Rum has a rich and creamy chocolate flavor imparted from a weeks-long infusion process. The drink’s name was inspired by Benito Juarez, a very influential former president of Mexico, who for a time was exiled in New Orleans, the birthplace of the Sazerac." —TE

      "This drink was inspired by the combination of cantaloupe liqueur and the intense cilantro flavor of the green chile vodka. There was an old cocktail of Shannon Tebay’s called Paradise Lost that was sort of a rhum agricole swizzle with the green chile vodka as a modifier, so I knew that would work here and help tie the whole composition together. Mai tais are an obvious angle on fruity rhum agricole drinks, so that was part of the picture as well. I think the whole idea popped into my head pretty fully formed, and the only thing that changed during the composition was to simplify the base to just include the rhum and the vodka; the rest of the spec is pretty close to what I originally wrote down in my notes. The name, in addition to being a super influential manga about a samurai and his young child, is apropos because ‘cantaloupe’ is from an Italian place-name meaning ‘song of the wolf,’ so I am always trying to come up with wolf-related names for cantaloupe drinks." —MB

      "Five Year Plan was created to satisfy the craving for a through-and-through autumn old fashioned (though it's craveable year-round). I started with the base of Yellowstone bourbon and boosted the high-rye notes by adding Delord Napoleon Armagnac. Armagnac is one of my favorite spirits, and one of my ways of introducing others to the category is by using it as a supporting player for bourbon. I doubled down on walnuts using black walnut bitters and Nocino, an Italian liqueur made with green walnuts. I then added a touch more sweetness and baking spice with cinnamon syrup. I love this old-fashioned because it's subtly complex and still completely recognizable as an old-fashioned. ‘Where do you see yourself in five years?’ is a question that sends me reeling into absolute panic, and naming this cocktail after it is the closest I've gotten to an answer." —SG

Its flavors are intended to highlight ingredients that pair well with honeydew melon. Legendario Domingo Guerrero mezcal has a minty, peppery, vegetal profile and a robust finish that loves both melon and the rich herbaceous quality of the shiso liqueur.

      "I was asked to make a whiskey sour for one of our menus, specifically one that only used back bar ingredients (no specialty infusions, syrups, or other advanced prep). I’m a fan of Monkey Shoulder Scotch for its stewed apple and baking spice notes, and knew that most Americans don’t typically reach for Scotch in their cocktails. I wanted to shed a little light on a spirit that doesn’t get the play it deserves on most menus, but use a style of drink that’s familiar. Apricot eau de vie adds a nice boost to the fruity notes in the Scotch, with Bénédictine playing into the scotch’s honeyed, spiced notes. Overall the cocktail is juicy, fruity, and bright—not the first thing people think when they hear Scotch is in their cocktail. Our bar manager (and my roommate) Jake Powell claims that I made this drink after coming home after a night out and feeling pretty buzzed with our other roommate. I supposedly got behind our home bar and made an early version of what would become Rhythm Section. " —EF

      "The Model Village was inspired by the Red Ant, which is one of my favorite Manhattan-style cocktails (and it happens to be a Death & Co modern classic as well, created by Thomas Waugh). The rich berry notes in my drink directly call back to the Red Ant, while the combination of Cognac and peated Scotch speaks more to my personal history with spirits. I also sought out all of the flavors people usually love in a classic Manhattan, but dialed up to eleven. This is a perfect cocktail to have with dinner, whether to contrast to a brightly flavored dish or to complement a rich and hearty meal." —JS

      "Darkness Calls began as a tequila negroni, but I wanted to make a variation that was darker and more robust, something that I would enjoy after a long day at work. Denizen’s Vatted Dark rum is a 100-proof blend of Guyana demerara rum and unaged rhum agricole, and gives the drink a deep baseline for everything to build upon. Using Punt e mas as the sweet vermouth component brings more bitterness, so I balanced it out with white crème de cacao, resulting in a bittersweet sipper with lovely orange and dark chocolate notes. Darkness calls to us all." —TS

      "One of my favorite flavor combinations is pineapple and coffee, which goes back to when I’d make cold-brew piña coladas for the staff when I worked at the Tartine Manufactory in San Francisco. The Sound System cocktail stems directly from that goofing around. Jamaican rum, madeira, pineapple, and espresso liqueur all come together to make a surprising and refreshing drink that always makes me want another. This daiquiri riff was so delicious that it became the go-to shot to send to friends when they visited Death & Co LA. We even had guests who would come in and request them, not knowing that they were actually a full cocktail from one of our first menus! The name Sound System was inspired by the Jamaican rum: In Jamaican popular culture starting in the 1950s, a “sound system” was a group of DJs, engineers and MCs playing ska, rocksteady or reggae music. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables and huge speakers and throw street parties for Jamaicans who were barred under colonial rule from participating in dances uptown." —TE

      "The Clandestino is a tequila-old fashioned style cocktail that was conceptualized with the flavor profile of a Thai basil and coconut curry. Being a stirred cocktail, it really let me dive into a more nuanced and upfront take on those flavors. The Aqua Perfecta basil eau de vie from St. George has become a staple at Death & Co LA and undeniably plays a huge role within the drink. Small touches of Kalani coconut liqueur and Green Chartreuse dial in a balance of rich and green herbal flavors that allows the tequila to take the wheel and drive it home. The drink’s name is an album title by world music artist Manu Chao, which I felt was fitting as the it’s flavors span from Thailand all the way to Mexico. " —MP

      "A lot of my drinks are based around a flavor combination of a dessert or dish I really enjoyed in the past. The Low End Theory is an old-fashioned riff based around the combination of banana and garam masala, two flavors I encountered in the form of a spiced banana muffin. My first thought was to use Transcontinental Rum Line Jamaican 2015 because it has tropical notes of banana and spices. To add some body to the drink, I added Knob Creek’s 9-year bourbon to pair with the rum (which is aged in ex-bourbon barrels) and some PX sherry to add a layer of nuttiness and velvety texture. And to introduce the flavor of garam masala, I decided to use Bitter End’s Moroccan bitters (which have prominent notes of cumin, cloves, black pepper, and cinnamon). The thing I like the most about this drink is the unexpected layers of flavors you get;  up front it’s tropical, then it’s nutty and spicy on the finish." —JR

      "Dragon Attack is a delicate Martinez riff with notes of ripe plum and cherry, rose, and juniper. The star of the show is the base spirit, St. George Dry Rye reposado gin, which is composed of a rye-based spirit that is re-distilled with gin botanicals aged in used wine casks. This gives a bit of a spiced and malty juniper component to the cocktail. The Cocchi Rossa lend a floral rose bitterness while also playing the part of vermouth. Umeshu is a plum wine that comes from Ume fruit that is stepped in Sake. The rowanberry eau-de-vie offers a nutty cherry flavor, which subs in for the Martinez’s signature maraschino liqueur. It’s an excellent spring cocktail that will please those who enjoy Manhattans, Martinis, and Negronis." —AA

The duo of whiskies rounds out the cocktails: Jura adds a toasty flavor reminiscent of a tart shell, while the smoky Islay scotch acts like a sprinkle of smoked salt on top of the dessert, giving it a hit of smokiness and a touch of salinity that ties all of the flavors together.

      "Old Sedona was my first contribution to Death and Co, and my goal was to make a very spirit-forward (yet approachable) stirred mezcal cocktail. It was heavily inspired by Alex Day's La Viña (an equal-parts blend of rye, amaro, and sherry), which I love for its bright raisiny and orange-y profile, and the OG Black Manhattan (rye and amaro). The biggest challenge was finding a proper second spirit and amaro to stand up to the mezcal, and the combination of Brandy de Jerez and Averna worked very well. (At home, you can substitute your favorite armagnac or cognac if you can't find Brandy de Jerez.) Perhaps my favorite aspect about Old Sedona is that even though the mezcal is the star of the show, the East India sherry is able to shine through and add a lot of complexity and rich fruity notes.

      "This old fashioned-style drink was inspired by ginger and macadamia shortbread. In the cocktail, the macadamia orgeat is the nutty sweetener while shochu adds a touch of malt and gingery spice. The Louis Roque Prune Brandy—a rich and juicy distillate made from three varieties of French plums that’s then aged for 5 years in French oak—brings a bit of nutty marzipan and stewed fruit flavors.

      "Coffee is one of my favorite ingredients to use in cocktails because it pairs with so many ingredients and flavors that people don’t expect—in this case tropical fruit like pineapple and banana. The Kingfisher is a play on the classic Jungle Bird where the coffee amaro replaces the usual Campari. Coffee brings a bitterness to cocktails that can be used to balance out much sweeter ingredients, so here it helps to unite a very rich banana puree and fresh pineapple juice with the deeper flavors of the blackstrap and Trinidadian rums." —TE

      We’re lucky enough to work with some of the world’s best distilleries on special bottlings and barrel selections to bring exclusive spirits into many of our cocktails. Kanayda Fierro’s Mr. Mojo Rising highlights one of these collaborations: Copalli Death & Co Cask Selection Rum, which is made in Belize from a native variety of sustainably grown organic sugarcane. We love how this rum lends both its bright sugarcane notes (it’s made in a similar fashion as rhum agricole) and the warming spices and cocoa flavors it picks up from resting in ex-bourbon barrels, which makes it a natural pairing for rye in the base of Kanayda’s basil- and peach-accented old-fashioned, the perfect drink for late summer. And while you’ll only find our special bottling of Copalli behind our bars, you can pick up their barrel-rested rum at your local liquor store or order it online.

      "This was a fun, ironic cocktail that I was kinda surprised to get greenlit. I enjoy a pickled cocktail onions with a dirty martini since the rich fattines of the olive brine gets cut with the acidity of the pickle. This got me thinking of the elements of cooking—salt, heat, fat, acid—and that Gibsons essentially are the ultimate test of ‘cold cooking’ in cocktails. Figuring out how to balance all these variables in the singular drink and making it consistent all the time is what made me go with a Freezer Bar martini route in lieu of stirring it. The colder it is (heat) the more body and texture the cocktail will have; the sherry brings a crisp salinity (salt) and bright minerality that aided the vinegar; rice wine vinegar had a better taste and since it's not super acidic made for a refreshing way to not overwhelm your palate when enjoying the cocktail (acid). Honestly I can go on forever on this one since I got to nerd out and used the most from my culinary background on this cocktail." —ER

It looks like an Old-Fashioned—served in a rocks glass over a large ice cube with an orange twist—but is built like a Manhattan variation, with a split base of Cognac, Calvados, and apricot eau de vie plus sweet vermouth and the bitter artichoke-y notes of Cynar. Whatever you want to call it, this uniquely built cocktail is approachable yet deliciously complex. 
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - ¾ ounce Hine Cognac
    - ½ ounce Roger Groult Calvados
    - ½ ounce Blume Marillen Apricot Eau de Vie
    - ½ ounce Cynar
    - ¾ ounce Cocchi Vermouth di Torino
    - "Garnish: 1 orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass over 1 large ice cube. 
    - Garnish with the orange twist.

      "Forgive & Forget was my take on a fall margarita. Growing up, pears were my favorite fruit and ripe pears were always a sign of the oncoming fall. I wanted to create something that would be crisp and bright, but still have autumnal flavors. Spiced pear liqueur brings warm poached pear and baking spices to the drink, while blanche Armagnac and tequila keeps it fresh and playful." —LT
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - Lime wedge
    - Black sea salt
    - 1½ ounces Arette blanco tequila
    - ½ ounce Delord Blanche Armagnac
    - ½ ounce St. George Spirits spiced pear liqueur
    - ¾ ounce fresh lime juice
    - ½ ounce Cane Sugar Syrup (2:1)
    - 1 dash Salt Solution
    - "Garnish: 1 lime wheel"
    steps:
    - Rub the lime wedge along the upper inch of a double old-fashioned glass, halfway around the circumference, then roll the wet portion in the salt. 
    - Put 1 large ice cube in the glass. 
    - Shake the remaining ingredients with ice, then strain into the prepared glass. 
    - Garnish with the lime wheel. 
    - Wet the rim of a double old-fashioned glass and roll it in the salt.
    - Shake all the ingredients with ice, then strain into a double old-fashioned glass over one large ice cube.

      "This drink is a simple-yet-fun take on a rum Negroni. When working on this cocktail I wanted to revisit the idea of pairing rum and black figs together. I had done so in the past and it was a fun concept! When discussing this idea with Matthew Belanger, he suggested tasting a newer expression of Brucato Amaro called Woodlands. I immediately knew this was the ticket to the black fig profile I needed without the mess of making a syrup or infusion. Papalin 7-year Jamaican rum is a steady player in our repertoire and this time it’s paired with Lustau East India Solera sherry, which helps push the raisin, dates, and chocolate flavors of the amaro. A small touch of crème de cacao keeps the drink well rounded and not too bitter." —MP
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 ounce Papalin 7-year Jamaican rum
    - 1 ounce Lustau East India solera sherry
    - ¾ ounce Brucato Woodlands Amaro

      "This old-fashioned was born out of a previous drink I created that never really worked out the way I planned. This is what I always wished that one would be. The split base of rye and apple brandy is a traditional combination usually denoted by the word “harvest” in the drink’s name (Harvest Old Fashioned, Harvest Sour, etc.). I’ve always been obsessed with the idea of folk heroes—people like John Henry and Paul Bunyan who were famous by word of mouth, and whose feats were often exaggerated to the point of myth. I always joke around that Evel Knievel was "the last American folk hero" and I like to think this drink is an homage to him." —JP

      "Honshu Underground was inspired by a classic Death & Co cocktail—the Honshu Punch—that featured single malt Japanese Whiskey, lemon and pineapple. Here I was trying to bring in a bit more of a Japanese culinary angle by pairing the Hibiki Harmony with yuzu in the form of a shochu-based yuzu liqueur. Additionally, the blend for Hibiki Harmony includes some whiskeys aged in Mizunara oak casks, a very rare and expensive Japanese oak that is often described as having an aroma reminiscent of sandalwood incense. So the sandalwood essence, along with the addition of a little heavily peated Scotch, was an attempt to accentuate that quality of the whiskey in the final drink—the almost coconutty, quality of those flavors helps balance the astringency and florality of the yuzu." —MB

    ingredients:
    - 1¼ ounces Hibiki Harmony Japanese whisky

    - ½ ounce fresh lemon juice
    - ½ ounce Vanilla Syrup
    - 1 dash Angostura bitters
    - 1 drop Sandalwood Essence (1 drop sandalwood essential oil mixed with 10 drops Port Charlotte or another high-proof spirit)

      "I wanted to create an approachable vodka martini and thought that a stirred version of a lychee martini would be a fun callback to the 1990's era of cocktails. Ketel One vodka makes a silky-smooth martini base, with St. George’s citrus vodka adding juicy notes. Dolin blanc vermouth might be the real star here, though, as it brings all the depth that a martini needs. A touch of cachaça adds a grassy note, and the lychee liqueur adds a touch of sweetness that you'd find in the 90's-style drinks. A lemon twist is a must, as its oils help bring a more rounded citrus flavor." —TS

      "This drink was inspired by family vacations to Mexico and driving around in a golf cart on Isla Mujeres off the coast of Cancun. Working from an assignment to develop an “agave old-fashioned,” I knew I wanted to use mezcal and add sotol (another Mexican spirit made from the desert spoon plant) for its vegetal, grassy, earthy notes. I played around with many infusions into the mezcal, but found the Vago Elote mezcal to be the most beneficial to the cocktail not only in flavor, but also for longevity of the D&C compendium. I also wanted a fruit component: giffard caribbean pineapple fit perfectly, as pineapple is my favorite fruit to eat in Mexico, and it compliments the cocktail with its carribean spice notes. The result is funky agave old-fashioned that’s approachable to new drinkers of mezcal and sotol alike. I’m a huge mezcal drinker, but have only used it in shaken cocktails, so this was an amazing-yet-challenging first cocktail to write for Death & Co!" —CS

      "This drink is really more of a mai tai than a fog cutter riff, but it does combine rum, gin, and an orange element (Averna), so it felt close enough to justify the name. I love the combination of banana, Averna, and funky rum, so this cocktail was really a selfish endeavor." —JP

      "The Unbreakable Diamond was born from a dish I discovered at a local restaurant: pickled tomatoes in plum vinegar. After tasting them, I knew I had to create a martini inspired by that unique flavor. It’s definitely one of the more unconventional cocktails I’ve crafted, but I’m thrilled with how well-balanced it turned out. I started with Moletto gin, which has a natural tomato note that really shines through. To soften it a bit, I added Fords gin for a smoother base. For the plum element, I incorporated a touch of umeshu plum wine and a dash of umeboshi vinegar. The blanc vermouth helps round out the flavor, while the rice vinegar adds a final layer of complexity. The real secret, though, lies in the garnish: the pickled green tomato. It’s a surprising treat at the end of the drink and really ties everything together." —RM

      "The Vizier’s Tale started with an ongoing quest of mine to pair cocktails with art, specifically Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Scheherazade.” I fell in love with the soaring violin theme that opens the second movement, which was in turn inspired by a character from One Thousand and One Nights—Scheherazade herself, the storyteller framing the narrative. Her story is one of purity, wit, and resilience in the face of the bitter, resentful king, so I aimed to incorporate that duality into the balance of the drink. The orange and iris petal of Caravedo Torontel pisco pair with Sauternes—a vibrant French dessert wine with delicate honeysuckle notes—to capture the airy elegance of her character and musical theme. Bonal, Salers, and Campari play the role of the king, threatening to take over with their intense, gentian-forward bitterness. I love how it evokes the essence of the story: the bitter finish entices me back to the bright bouquet, so I just can’t put it down." —JS

      "Tears of Gold is a blend of two caffeinated classics, the espresso martini and the carajillo (a Spanish drink made with espresso and Licor 43). I designed it to be a lighter, more approachable variation of an espresso-based cocktail. For the base spirit, I chose reposado tequila for its warm caramel notes, which beautifully complement the vanilla-forward sweetness of Licor 43. Grappa serves as the bridge, harmonizing these flavors while adding depth and an unexpected elegant touch. And a dash of mole bitters brings the drink to a perfect finish, rounding out the profile with subtle spice and complexity." —JS

      "The Crimson Art is a riff on the Pink Lady, a classic cocktail made with gin, applejack, and grenadine that was historically miscast as a ‘girly drink,’ but which is actually quite complex and not the least bit dainty. When creating my adaptation, I wanted to invoke something festive for the holiday season. I’ve always liked the punchy, pine-y flavor profile of St. George Terroir Gin, so I started developing with that and cranberry in mind, using calvados in place of applejack, cranberry liqueur instead of grenadine, and a touch of Lazzaroni Amaretto, an Italian liqueur infused with the almond and apricot flavors of the company’s famous Amaretti Di Saronno cookies. I'm really happy with how this cocktail turned out: one sip and I can practically hear the sleigh bells ringing." —RM

      Making great nonalcoholic cocktails often requires more development and prep work than their boozy brethren. That’s not the case with Exit Music, an NA Negroni crafted entirely from four off-the-shelf ingredients. Ritual’s Zero Proof Gin Alternative and Lyre’s Pink London Spirit combine to make a close approximation of gin, while Giffard’s Sirop Aperitif and Martini & Rossi’s Vibrante NA L'Aperitivo combine to add the citrus and botanical profiles that Campari and sweet vermouth usually provide.
