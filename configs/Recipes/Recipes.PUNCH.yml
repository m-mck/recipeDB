  glassware: toddy mug
  ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 oz brandy or bourbon
    - 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
    - 1/4 ounce Hunt + Alpine Cardamom-Coriander Syrup
    - 1/2 ounce ginger syrup
  steps:
    - Preheat a glass mug by filling it with hot water. Leave the water in for now and set it aside.
    - To prepare the drink, you'll want a heat-conducting vessel that fits into a second container. 
    - Two metal mixing tins work great. Fill the first with enough hot water that the second container floats in the water when placed inside the first. Essentially, you are creating a small bain-marie to preheat the ingredients without diluting them.
    - Add the brandy or bourbon, lemon juice, cardamom-coriander syrup, and ginger syrup to your mixing tins and stir gently until heated through.
    - Empty the water from the preheated mug and immediately fill it with the heated cocktail.
    - Top with 3 ounces of hot water. 
    - Express the Orange twist over the drink, and place the cinnamon stick into the drink.

  author: John Parra & Kyle Hankin
  notes: |+2
      Consider this a neo-tiki Negroni, with blackstrap rum and Ferrari (Fernet mixed with Campari) taking the place of traditional gin and Campari. Part of the Autostrada menu at Fox Liquor Bar, this drink was inspired by Giuseppe Gonzalez's revamp of the Jungle Bird. The blackstrap rum gives it a rich, molasses-y spice, while the Ferrari offers herbal bitterness.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients:
  - 3 drops saline solution (Add 1/2 ounce kosher salt to 2 ounces of water and stir until dissolved.)
  - 1 ounce Cocchi di Torino
  - ½ ounce Fernet-Branca
  - ½ ounce Campari
  - 1 ounce blackstrap rum, preferably Cruzan
  - "Garnish: Orange twist"
  steps:
  - In a mixing glass, combine the saline, Cocchi, Ferrari and rum. Add one large cube of ice and stir until very cold.
  - Strain into a rocks glass over large cube of ice. Garnish with Orange twist and serve.

      "Bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler of the Clyde Common in Portland, Oregon, created the Flannel Shirt for an autumnal event. Using classic fall flavors—apple, earth, spice and smoke—he whipped up this fleecy, bone-warming drink with the bold backbone of Scotch and a supporting cast of apple cider, St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and super-bold Averna.

      "Kenneth McCoy traces the origin of this drink back to a time in which he sampled an array of stirred cocktails in liqueur-rinsed coupes. He found particular harmony between whiskey-based drinks and small amounts of green Chartreuse. “Whether it was a bourbon, a rye, or a single malt, it just elevated the cocktail,” he recalls. “It just gives another edge to the cocktail.”"

  steps:
  - In a mixing glass, stir first three ingredients with ice.
  - Swirl Chartreuse in a coupe glass, using enough to generously coat the interior. 
  - Use a long-handled match to set the liqueur on fire.

  notes: |+2
      The Diamond Fizz was born around the turn of this century, when the fizz was hitting the big time in American bars. A deceptively strong and highly drinkable mixture, it replaces the Gin Fizz's soda water with Champagne, transforming it into a royale of sorts. Isaac Shumway's spritz-ified version replaces the gin with Aperol and dry vermouth, the sugar with honey syrup and amaro, and the lemon juice with orange juice. The result is a fluffy orange cloud of a cocktail that tastes something like a bitter Orange Julius.
  glassware: collins
  ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 ounces Aperol
  - 1/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
  - 1/2 ounce dry vermouth, preferably Dolin
  - 1/2 ounce honey syrup
  - 1/4 ounce Gran Classico Bitter amaro
  - 1 teaspoon fresh orange juice
  - 1 egg white
  - 2 1/2 ounces sparkling wine
  steps:
  - Add the Aperol, lemon juice, vermouth, syrup, Gran Classico, orange juice, and egg white to a cocktail shaker.
  - Shake without ice, and then add ice and shake very hard for 20 seconds.
  - Strain into a Collins glass over a very small amount of ice.
  - Slowly top with the sparkling wine and add the garnish.
  - To make the honey syrup, combine 2 parts honey and 1 part water in a saucepan over very low heat. Stir until the honey is dissolved. Remove from the heat and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Bottle and store in the refrigerator for up to one month.

      When Toby Maloney opened The Violet Hour, one of the first serious craft cocktail bars to open in no-nonsense Chicago, in 2007, he wanted to create a gin cocktail that would appeal to gin haters. The result was the Juliet & Romeo, a mix of gin, lime juice, cucumber, sugar, mint, salt and rose water. “I wanted it to taste like a walk through an English garden,” says Maloney. His plan succeeded. The drink has been among the top two sellers for the last 12 years; in 2019, the bar sold an average of 20 a day. To put that in perspective, only the Old-Fashioned sells more. “It's as close to a house drink as we have,” says Maloney. It's also jumped to other bars in town. The day Maloney sees it on the most menus? Valentine's Day, naturally.

  notes: |+2
      In making this “Viking-tiki”-inspired Swedish glögg, bartender Gabriella Mlynarczyk found that aquavit is a good partner for tropical ingredients, like allspice dram, pineapple and vanilla-inflected velvet falernum (though rum or even brandy can be substituted in this recipe). She recommends using a full-bodied, even jammy, bottle of wine to give the drink a generous fruitiness that's balanced by warming spices, like ginger and pink peppercorns. Serves 4 to 6.
  glassware: mug
  ingredients:
  - 1 750mL bottle dry red wine
  - 2 cups velvet falernum
  - 2 ounces allspice dram
  - 2 cups pineapple juice
  - 1/2 cup aquavit, rum or brandy
  - steeping ingredients (peel of 1 orange; peel of 1 lime; 5 cloves; 2 cinnamon sticks; 2 to 3 slices fresh ginger; 1 teaspoon szechuan or pink peppercorns; 3 bay leaves)
  - sugar, to taste (optional)
  steps:
  - Place the steeping ingredients on a square of cheesecloth, then bring the corners together and tie them securely with kitchen twine to make a "teabag." Then, place in a large pot.
  - Add all of the liquid ingredients, to the pot, except for the aquavit.
  - Place the pot over low heat and simmer the mixture for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat.
  - Add the aquavit and ladel the mulled wine into mugs, adding sugar to taste (if desired).
  - Garnish with an orange peel and a cinnamon stick or a sprig of pink peppercorns.

      While consulting for British-themed bar and restaurant Dear Bushwick, Natasha David envisioned the menu as the documented travels of a Naval officer sailing around the world. “I always think of salt and Campari as going well together,” says David of combining the Italian bitter with salted lime cordial. “I think of them like herbs and salt in cooking—they have the ability to bring everything together.” A loose play on the Gin Sour, the Brave Benbow combines two historic styles of gin—Navy strength and Old Tom—and is named for a British admiral.

      "At first attempting to riff on a Blood and Sand, Christiaan Rollich of AOC in Los Angeles created the White Bull almost by accident. Getting lost somewhere between adding and subtracting different ingredients, a new drink was born: gin instead of scotch, sage beer syrup instead of cherry liqueur, and the addition of Cocchi Americano, lemon, angostura and Hefeweizen. Served in a Collins glass with a sage leaf garnish, Rollich credits the name to removing the ‘blood' part of a Blood and Sand and replacing it with a white beer for what drinks like a winter shandy."

  notes: |+2
      Named for its so-called healing properties, the Penicillin—bartender Sam Ross' smoky and spicy twist on a Whiskey Sour—has become a modern classic in the cocktail canon. Victoria presents a cold-weather update by warming it up, literally, with hot apple cider sweetened with a fragrant honey syrup. The familiar Scotch whisky of the original gets a spicy kick of ginger root from Fever-Tree Ginger Beer, and added brightness from fresh lemon. “It's warming, with a smoky spice flavor,” she says, “and perfect for transitioning into winter.”
  glassware: mug
  ingredients:
  - 1 ounce Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch Whisky
  - 1 ounce hot apple cider
  - 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice
  - 1/4 ounce honey syrup (2:1 honey to water)
  - Fever-Tree Ginger Beer
  steps:
  - Temper a mug with hot water to warm.
  - Discard hot water and combine Scotch, cider, lemon juice and honey syrup in the mug.

      Created in collaboration with fellow New York bartenders Tom Macy and Shannon Ponche, the Negroni de Nubes is not your average Negroni variation. Unsmoked mezcal forms the base, leaving room for the delicate flavors of a strawberry-infused Cappelletti-Suze mixture and the botanicals of blanc vermouth to shine through. “It just needed one final touch,” recalls Leanne Favre. “I had the idea to use rice to contribute texture and mouthfeel, drawing inspiration from the starchy texture of horchata.” Stirring the mixture with a few tablespoons of rice acts as an à la minute rice wash that lends texture and “delightful creaminess” to the drink.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients:
  - 1 1/4 ounces mezcal, preferably Derrumbes San Luis Potosí

      “Jagermeister is nice burned,” says Dave Arnold. “A lot of bitter liqueurs are nice when they are burned.” For this drink, he applies a flame to caramelize the sugar in the liqueur as well as to heat it, yielding a warming, gently spiced drink.

  ingredients:
  - 2 teaspoons sugar
  - 2 ounces Jägermeister
  - 1/4 ounce lemon juice
  - 1 pinch salt

  steps:
  - Heat sugar in a saucepan, until caramelized.
  - Add Jägermeister, lemon juice and salt to pan.

      Spawned in the late aughts at LAB—London's influential high-energy, high-volume bar—this spin on a classic has had a cult following since its creation in 2005. More recently, the drink has united online cocktail enthusiasts who are in search of the best substitute for green Chartreuse, the drink's key ingredient, which has become increasingly scarce.

      At his Lisbon kiosk, Quiosque de São Paulo, André Magalhães balances fragrant, sweet Amarguinha, a Portuguese bitter-almond liqueur, with equal parts fresh-squeezed lemon juice, serving the drink over ice, with lemon peel for an additional hit of aroma. This recipe calls for one and a half ounces each of Amarguinha and lemon juice, but you should be generous with your pours—Magalhães certainly is. Portugal's iconic brand of bitter-almond liqueur, Amarguinha, is available at a handful of shops in the United States.

  ingredients: 
  - 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled

      At Vals in New Orleans, Margarita specials rotate based on the season. The Mango Margarita is a refreshing combination of tequila, sugar, lime juice, orange liqueur and puréed mango. It's typically made in a frozen-drink machine, but this version is scaled down for a home blender.
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 16 ounces frozen chunks of mango (freshly cut then frozen, or store-bought)
  - 15 ounces (a scant 2 cups) blanco tequila, preferably Tequila Ocho Plata
  - 10 ounces (about 1 ¼ cups) lime juice
  - 5 ounces orange liqueur, preferably Cointreau or Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao
  - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Del Maguey Vida
  - 2 ounces simple syrup
  - "Garnish: lime wedge"
  steps:
  - Blend all ingredients together until smooth. Set mixture aside. (This should make about 1 1/2 quarts of blended ingredients, which can be kept in the refrigerator until ready to serve).
  - "When ready to serve: To achieve the desired frozen texture, add ice cubes to the mixture bit by bit, and blend to desired texture."
  - Serves 6.

      "The Stone Raft is a weird one,” says Phil Ward of the New York agave den Mayahuel. “I figured that people weren't going to like it or order it, but I thought it was so god-damn good I put it on the menu anyway.” A combination of amontillado, mezcal, jalapeño tequila, celery bitters, and a barspoon of agave nectar, the Stone Raft is a distant cousin of the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, one of the first drinks Ward ever made with mezcal. The Stone Raft was born out of a long line of riffs on the drink. The adamantly savory combination of herbal-smoky-nutty is unusual, but despite Ward's prediction that the drink would be met with sneers, it went on to become the obsession of many fans of Mayahuel and has been a mainstay until the bar's closure in 2017."

  notes: |+2
      In this version of Madeira's signature drink, a bit of lemon zest is added to the traditional ingredients of rhum agricole, citrus juice and honey. In Ilda Marques' words, the ingredient lends the drink a bit more “creaminess,” and it provides an additional hit of citrus tartness and aroma to counter the sweetness of the honey. On Madeira, poncha is made exclusively with locally made white rhum agricole. This recipe was made using Branca 40 percent, made by Engenhos do Norte, a standard product on the island. In the U.S., Madeiran rum is nearly impossible to find, so look for any other unaged rhum agricole between 80 and 100 proof. It's also unlikely you'll be able to find an authentic caralhinho, the wooden tool used to “whip” the drink, but a wooden spoon does the job.
  glassware: nick & nora
  ingredients: 
  - 2 swaths of lemon peel (around 3 grams total)
  - 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
  - scant 1 1/2 ounces white rhum agricole, chilled
  - scant 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed orange juice, chilled
  - 1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled
  - 1 teaspoon honey
  steps:
  - In a heavy pint glass (or small glass pitcher, if making more than one drink), muddle the lemon peel and sugar, pounding and grinding until you have a uniform paste.
  - Add the rhum agricole, lemon juice, orange juice and honey. Holding a caralhinho (or wooden spoon) between your palms, insert it in the mixture and spin it until the ingredients are integrated and frothy.
  - Taste, adding more lemon juice or honey depending on the flavor of your ingredients; it should be just barely sweet followed by tart and fragrant flavors.
  - Strain the mixture through a sieve into a small, stemmed glass or alternatively, over ice into a tall glass.

      "Essentially a Gin Sour made with lime juice, legend has it that the Gimlet was created in the mid-19th century to encourage Royal Navy sailors to consume their rations of scurvy-preventing lime juice. The name? Possibly a reference to Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a naval medical officer who served during that era. Rose's Lime Cordial, a syrup of sugar and lime juice, was invented around the same time to preserve lime juice during long bouts at sea; fundamentalist versions of the drink still call for it. The Rose's of today, however, is a different animal, with high-fructose corn syrup and additives—stuff that wouldn't make it past the door of any self-respecting craft cocktail bar. This version is Brooklyn bartender Toby Cecchini's rendition, which he serves at The Long Island Bar on Atlantic Avenue. His Gimlet is infused with ginger-lime cordial and served on the rocks."

      Key to the success of the Diamond Noir is the fat-washing process that lends the drink its unexpected velvety texture. Eric Simmons takes a milk punch-inspired approach by filtering the entire cocktail—bourbon, yuzu juice, lemon juice and Demerara syrup—through heavy cream. The final product is then topped with a cabernet float, yielding a New York Sour-adjacent cocktail that feels right at home against a menu of pasta and Italian wine. As Simmons explains, “It has all the [elements of] the restaurant tied into one drink.”

  steps:
  - Combine all ingredients, except the half and half, in an 8 quart container.
  - In a separate 8 quart container, add half and half.
  - Pour the cocktail mixture (the first container) over the half and half and let sit for 30 minutes. You should see the punch curdle, this is a good thing. Line a fine mesh strainer with a damp cloth napkin or cheese cloth and place strainer over a deli container and slowly pour about 8 ounces of the mixture through the cloth. The first liquid coming through will be a bit hazy so move the strainer to another container and continue to let the mixture slowly collect into the container. Continue to pour more of the mixture through the strainer. It will yield around 2 deli containers.

      “I wanted to create a cocktail that kind of encapsulates the Filipino American experience,” says Napier Bulanan, who translates the ubiquitous fruit punch of family gatherings into cocktail form. A base of lambanog, a distilled palm spirit, is bolstered by aquavit, sweetened with lychee syrup and given a tart kick from fresh lime juice. The whole mixture is then clarified, milk punch-style, using coconut milk.  Serves 10.
  glassware: rocks

  - "Garnish: a spritz of pinipig tincture and an orchid"
  steps:
  - Combine the first four ingredients in a large container to create a cocktail mixture.
  - Pour the coconut milk into a separate large container, then add the cocktail mixture. Stir the mixture and let rest for 30 minutes.
  - Line a large chinois with a clean kitchen napkin, and set it inside a large container. Slowly pour the mixture through the chinois. (You may have to pour it in batches, because the straining process takes time.) Pour the clarified cocktail into a reusable bottle and refrigerate.
  - When ready to serve, pour 3 ounces of the mixture into a mixing glass with ice, and strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.

      How do you take a drink whose essence relies on both a beach and a blender and make it the sort of drink you'd sip near the fire? The Piña Colada so singularly symbolizes summer it seems an almost impossible feat to make it winter appropriate. Almost. This here Piña Colada Milk Punch maintains the essence of the drink's tropical spirit with coconut water, pineapple juice, rum (and velvet falernum for extra credit), but it's transformed by adding scalded milk, clarifying the mixture with a cheese cloth and then ladling it, punch-style, on the rocks. Serves 8-10.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 14 ounces aged rum, preferably Plantation 5-Year
  - 8 ounces coconut water

  - 4 ounces pineapple juice
  - 3 ounces lime juice
  - 6 ounces milk
  - "Garnish: pineapple slice, maraschino cherry"
  steps:
  - Pour the rum, coconut water, Velvet falernum, pineapple juice, lime juice, and demerara syrup into a heatsafe mixing bowl.
  - Over medium-low heat, heat the milk in a saucepan, stirring continuously until the milk begins to bubble around the edges (taking care not to let it boil).
  - Add the milk to the mixing bowl, stir until it begins to coagulate, and let the mixture sit for 15 minutes.
  - Strain through a cheesecloth or coffee filter until the mixture is clarified.

      "Featuring the odd trio of absinthe, yellow Chartreuse and apricot liqueur, the Yellow Parrot is not your average equal-parts cocktail. While the ingredients read incongruously on paper, they unify in the mixing glass to create something unexpected in both taste and texture. The key to achieving the best results with this recipe, which first appeared in London bartender Robert Vermeire's Cocktails: How to Mix Them (1922), is an extended stirring time of at least 1 minute. Dilution encourages latent flavors in the absinthe and Chartreuse to emerge, and causes an emulsifying louche effect that imbues the drink with a silky, almost velvety mouthfeel."

      "When on the hunt for a lesser-known rum classic, Jewel Murray and her team workshopped several cocktails from The Savoy Cocktail Book until they found a winner: the Pauline. Bartender Daniel Sanchez spearheaded the development of the spec, which leans on an unusual Haitian rum that combines two clairins and an unaged rum. The wormwood bitters of the original recipe are here replaced by a combination of absinthe and orange bitters, while the original recipe's nutmeg had to stay for this winterized rum sour."

      A deep cut from The Savoy Cocktail Book, the Yolanda is something of a candied Martini, building off a base of vermouth complemented by smaller proportions of gin and brandy. While Harry Craddock's original recipe calls for sweet Italian vermouth, Portland, Maine-based bartender LyAnna Sanabria subs in the semi-sweet Comoz Blanc providing a brighter canvas for her spring-friendly rendition. Bimini Coconut Gin, from Maine's Round Turn Distilling, and Capurro Acholado Pisco are the lighter stand-ins for the London dry gin and Cognac specified in the pages of Savoy.

      Can we legitimately call this drink, which originates in 1977's Two-in-One International Recipe Card Collection for Mixed Drinks and Hors d'oeuvre, a “Sazerac”? Probably not, but Takoi beverage director Drew Pompa thinks it deserves a fair shake nonetheless. A split base of Guyanese and Jamaican rums provides a well-calibrated starting point, complemented by a number of disparate but cooperative ingredients, including Louisiana staples Peychaud's bitters and Crystal Hot.

      The 1974 edition of the Old Mr. Boston Official Bartender's Guide is responsible for introducing the Hot Pants cocktail—a perplexing combination of tequila, peppermint schnapps, grapefruit juice and powdered sugar, shaken and poured into a salt-rimmed glass. It sounds like it shouldn't work—and it really doesn't, at least as originally constituted. But something about the Hot Pants intrigued Tammy Bouma, inspiring her to update the oddball sour for modern tastes. Her version omits peppermint schnapps in favor of a fresh mint tea syrup.

      Though it has the air of a pre-Prohibition cocktail, the Cloister actually originates with the Playboy Bartender's Guide, published in 1971. A gin sour that relies on two types of citrus, its monastic name is a nod to its inclusion of yellow Chartreuse, the complex herbal liqueur produced by the Carthusian monks of southeastern France. For New Orleans bartender Christina Rando, It's the ideal “gateway” drink capable of converting skeptics into avowed Chartreuse fans. She prefers this variation from Jim Meehan's 2011 PDT Cocktail Book, which introduces a touch of simple syrup to counterbalance the fresh grapefruit and lemon.

Chantal Tseng was the only bartender in the tasting to opt for a measure of rhum agricole—a half-ounce, which she paired with overproof Jamaican and Demerara rums. Though the absinthe—a full quarter-ounce, compared to the drops and dashes of most other recipes—tilted the drink away from the archetype, it still stuck in the judges' minds after tasting (and re-tasting) the lineup."

      "The challenges and triumphs Alex Waldman faces owning Istanbul's only craft cocktail bar are perhaps best summarized by the Dead Celebrity. In March of 2013, Waldman explains, “I got my first batch of sherries into the bar: fino, amontillado, oloroso and PX. Within a week I had solved all but the oloroso. I struggled to mix it for weeks, and finally, on the verge of despair I decided to try it with green chartreuse.” The result is the Dead Celebrity, a somewhat unlikely mix of sherry, green Chartreuse, Scotch and lemon and rhubarb bitters."

      “There are so many Manhattan variations, but I hadn't seen one done with Japanese whisky yet,” says bartender Brad Farran. With this blueprint in mind, Farran substituted American whiskey with the subtly complex Yamazaki, while adding layers to the sweet vermouth via the addition of spicy Cardamaro and saffron-infused Strega. Farran named his cocktail in reference to the third installment of the Fast and the Furious movies, which he thinks, “is pretty hilarious.”

  notes: |+2
      A milk-washed riff on a Vieux Carré—“we swapped every ingredient, except Bénédictine,” Daniel Villa says—this drink uses toasted powdered milk to yield a silky cocktail that tastes “as though it was simultaneously milk-punched and brown-butter fat-washed.” The sunken raisin garnish is a bonus. “It's almost a rum raisin cure in the drink,” he says. “By the time you're done, they're delicious, and you can enjoy them at the end as a snack.” Yields one 750ml bottle, or about eight 3-ounce servings.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 8 ounces rehydrated toasted whole milk
  - 9 ounces reposado tequila, preferably El Tesoro
  - 6 ounces amontillado sherry
  - 3 ounces Pedro Ximénez sherry
  - 2 ounces mezcal, preferably Ilegal Joven
  - 1 1/2 ounces Bénédictine
  - 1 1/2 ounces Cynar
  - 1/2 teaspoon bitters (Villa prefers Crude Cardamom & Caramelized Raisin bitters, a limited-edition bottling, but says an equal amount of any style of bitters will work)
  steps:
  - Pour the rehydrated milk into a large mixing cup or Cambro.
  - In a second container, add the remaining ingredients, and stir to combine. Add the batched cocktail into the container with the rehydrated milk. Give it a gentle stir, and let it sit for about 10 minutes, during which it should curdle.
  - Pour the cocktail mixture through a fine-mesh sieve (a chinois strainer lined with a moistened linen towel or a micron bag/Superbag will also work) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be slightly cloudy.
  - Pour the cocktail mixture a second time through the same sieve (including through the curds in the sieve) into a clean container. The resulting liquid should be fairly clear.
  - Funnel into a bottle and cap. Keeps, indefinitely, at room temperature.
  - To serve, pour 3 ounces over big ice, and stir to chill.
  - Garnish with raisins, which should sink to the bottom of the glass.

  notes: |+2
      At Boston's Eastern Standard, bar manager Diego Peña takes inspiration from a London Fog (essentially an Earl Grey tea latte) in this wintry milk punch. It calls for a warming blend of bourbon, brandy and rum alongside Earl Grey syrup. Yields 3 quarts.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 2 cups bourbon
  - 1 cup brandy
  - 3/4 cup Jamaican rum
  - "1 3/4 cup Earl Grey syrup (1:1 earl grey tea:granulated sugar)"
  - 1 3/4 cup lemon juice
  - 1 2/3 cup whole milk
  - 3/4 cup half and half
  - Zest of one lemon (optional)
  - 1 dash vanilla extract (optional)
  - "Garnish: grated nutmeg"
  steps:
  - Add all ingredients, except milk and half and half (plus lemon and vanilla, if using), to a nonreactive container.
  - Combine the milk, half and half, lemon zest and vanilla over in a pot over the stove and heat to 180ºF.
  - Add milk to the nonreactive container and allow it to rest for approximately 3 minutes.
  - In a clean container, place a mesh strainer with a single thin layer of cheesecloth or coffee filter on top. Start the straining process by allowing the punch to pass through. Do not remove the curds—they help with the clarification. When you notice the rate of liquid passing through has slowed down, transfer the curd-filled strainer into a clean container.
  - Add the contents from the other container to the top of the strainer and slowly top of until its completely passed through. It takes some time depending on the batch.
  - Serve in a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
  - Garnish with grated nutmeg.

This recipe calls for one and a half ounces each of Amarguinha and lemon juice, but you should be generous with your pours—Magalhães certainly is. Portugal's iconic brand of bitter-almond liqueur, Amarguinha, is available at a handful of shops in the United States.

      "The Stone Raft is a weird one,” says Phil Ward of the New York agave den Mayahuel. “I figured that people weren't going to like it or order it, but I thought it was so god-damn good I put it on the menu anyway.” A combination of amontillado, mezcal, jalapeño tequila, celery bitters, and a barspoon of agave nectar, the Stone Raft is a distant cousin of the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned, one of the first drinks Ward ever made with mezcal. The Stone Raft was born out of a long line of riffs on the drink. The adamantly savory combination of herbal-smoky-nutty is unusual, but despite Ward's prediction that the drink would be met with sneers, it went on to become the obsession of many fans of Mayahuel and has been a mainstay until the bar's closure in 2017."

The drink itself is classic, too—a simple 2-1 ratio of Japanese gin to dry vermouth—but with a thoroughly modern twist courtesy of an “umami bomb” infusion. For a traditionally sized serving, simply double the recipe."

  notes: |+2
      In this version of Madeira's signature drink, a bit of lemon zest is added to the traditional ingredients of rhum agricole, citrus juice and honey. In Ilda Marques' words, the ingredient lends the drink a bit more “creaminess,” and it provides an additional hit of citrus tartness and aroma to counter the sweetness of the honey. On Madeira, poncha is made exclusively with locally made white rhum agricole. This recipe was made using Branca 40 percent, made by Engenhos do Norte, a standard product on the island. In the U.S., Madeiran rum is nearly impossible to find, so look for any other unaged rhum agricole between 80 and 100 proof. It's also unlikely you'll be able to find an authentic caralhinho, the wooden tool used to “whip” the drink, but a wooden spoon does the job.
  glassware: pint glass
  ingredients: 
  - 2 swaths of lemon peel (around 3 grams total)
  - 1/2 teaspoon white sugar
  - scant 1 1/2 ounces white rhum agricole, chilled
  - scant 1 1/2 ounces fresh-squeezed orange juice, chilled
  - 1 ounce fresh-squeezed lemon juice, chilled
  - 1 teaspoon honey
  steps:
  - In a heavy pint glass (or small glass pitcher, if making more than one drink), muddle the lemon peel and sugar, pounding and grinding until you have a uniform paste.
  - Add the rhum agricole, lemon juice, orange juice and honey. Holding a caralhinho (or wooden spoon) between your palms, insert it in the mixture and spin it until the ingredients are integrated and frothy.
  - Taste, adding more lemon juice or honey depending on the flavor of your ingredients; it should be just barely sweet followed by tart and fragrant flavors.
  - Strain the mixture through a sieve into a small, stemmed glass or alternatively, over ice into a tall glass.

      "Essentially a Gin Sour made with lime juice, legend has it that the Gimlet was created in the mid-19th century to encourage Royal Navy sailors to consume their rations of scurvy-preventing lime juice. The name? Possibly a reference to Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a naval medical officer who served during that era. Rose's Lime Cordial, a syrup of sugar and lime juice, was invented around the same time to preserve lime juice during long bouts at sea; fundamentalist versions of the drink still call for it. The Rose's of today, however, is a different animal, with high-fructose corn syrup and additives—stuff that wouldn't make it past the door of any self-respecting craft cocktail bar. This version is Brooklyn bartender Toby Cecchini's rendition, which he serves at The Long Island Bar on Atlantic Avenue. His Gimlet is infused with ginger-lime cordial and served on the rocks."

Biancaniello muddles a big handful of spicy arugula rustica he gets from a Southern California purveyor into agave syrup and fresh lime juice before adding organic gin from Colorado. The result is a tree-frog green cocktail with a piquant tang that he pours up or over a large cube of ice."
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 2 ounces gin (preferably CapRock)
  - 3/4 ounce lime juice
  - 3/4 ounce agave syrup (1:1, agave:water)

  steps:
  - In a mixing glass, muddle arugula with lime juice and agave syrup.
  - Add gin and ice, and shake until well chilled.

      Every time I would go over to my grand parents' house they would make rice pudding,” recalls Demi Natoli. “There was always just a giant stick of cinnamon in there and the best part was licking the little crispy parts at the bottom of the pot.” To mimic the flavor of this dessert, Natoli incorporates Saigon cinnamon and coconut syrups atop a rum base, as well as amontillado sherry which provides a certain nuttiness to the drink. In a cheeky nod to her favorite part of the dessert, she garnishes the drink with a bite-size rice crispy treat. “It all rounds out to be just like a beautiful flip cocktail,” says Natoli.

      Key to the success of the Diamond Noir is the fat-washing process that lends the drink its unexpected velvety texture. Eric Simmons takes a milk punch-inspired approach by filtering the entire cocktail—bourbon, yuzu juice, lemon juice and Demerara syrup—through heavy cream. The final product is then topped with a cabernet float, yielding a New York Sour-adjacent cocktail that feels right at home against a menu of pasta and Italian wine. As Simmons explains, “It has all the [elements of] the restaurant tied into one drink.”
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 2 ounces overproof bourbon
  - 1/2 ounce yuzu juice
  - 1/2 ounce lemon juice
  - 3/4 ounce burnt demerara syrup
  - 1/4 ounce amontillado sherry
  - 4 ounces heavy cream
  - cabernet, to float
  steps:
  - Combine all ingredients, except for the wine, and freeze for one hour.
  - Strain the mixture through a coffee filter until clarified.
  - In a mixing glass, stir the clarified mixture with ice until properly diluted.

      "Jim Kearns describes this drink as perfect for early autumn. “A Martini is a bright, summery drink,” he explains. By comparison, “an Alaska's got that saffron-honey quality from the yellow Chartreuse, and that's bolstered by the softness of the Old Tom gin,” a lightly sweetened style. Taken together, it's a Martini-style drink with less bite and a little more roundness. In addition, Kearns readily admits that the 2 1/4 measure of gin is “a little funky,” so he offers this nifty trick: fill a 3/4-ounce jigger three times with gin, which adds up to 2 1/4 total. That same 3/4-ounce jigger can then be used to measure the yellow Chartreuse. “You don't even have to switch jiggers!”"

      The Fourth Regiment, first recorded in the 1880s, was part of an explosion of Manhattan-like cocktails featuring the triumvirate of whiskey, vermouth and bitters. This one was an outlier because of the inclusion of celery bitters, in addition to Peychaud's and orange versions. At the Austin bar DrinkWell, the Fourth Regiment is made with bonded rye, a light and herbal vermouth, Peychaud's bitters and celery shrub, which bar manager Caer Maiko says makes it an ideal warm-weather Manhattan that delivers pleasing savory notes.

Her modern takes on punch celebrate the flavors and spirits of the Caribbean and Gulf regions while incorporating contemporary techniques and unconventional ingredients. (Today's wealth of agave spirits wasn't so close at hand for yesterday's punch makers.)

      Ned King's admiration for the New York Sour started with its enticing appearance, but he's gained an appreciation for its effect on his guests, too. Because it's a variation on the classic Whiskey Sour, King says it provides his customers with a stepping stone to the more complex drinks on his bar's menu. When building his version, he begins with a sturdy base of 100-proof rye, lemon juice, and 2:1 cane sugar syrup. For the float, he uses a Spanish red, Pedro Gonzalez Mittelbrunn Castilla y León—its “currant-raisin-spice character” complements the rye whiskey, King notes—being sure not to exceed his ideal measure of a half-ounce of wine.
  glassware: double rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 2 ounces 100-proof rye, preferably Rittenhouse
  - 1 ounce lemon juice
  - "1/2 ounce rich cane sugar syrup (2:1, cane sugar: hot water)"

It's topped with a float of violet liqueur, which gives it the gunmetal-gray appearance that inspired the name. “I remember smelling the mezcal and thinking immediately of flowers, so I tried it with the violet [liqueur],” she says.

      A “heavy half-ounce” - meaning slightly more than just a half-ounce - of lemon juice is added to the glass, and then the rest of the ingredients are shaken and poured on top. This has the effect of “sinking” the lemon to the bottom of the glass. “You're getting little bits of just lemon juice in each sip,” explains Jelani Johnson, which helps balance the effect of the robust pineapple and maple-flavored syrup.

      According to Cub and Dandelyan bartender Ryan Chetiyawardana, it's always best to begin making at-home infusions with low-ABV bases. While traditional infusion methods (i.e. adding your ingredients to liquid and letting it sit in a cool, dry place) will take longer, using an iSi to “charge” the infusion is as fast as it gets. This infusion of fino sherry turns the wine into a ready-to-drink cocktail—just add ice. Serves 4.
  glassware: wine glass
  ingredients: 
  - 2 1/2 cups fino sherry
  - 3 fresh cherries, pitted
  - 2 sprigs mint
  - 1 sprig basil

  - half of one spit vanilla pod
  steps:
  - Add all ingredients to an iSi canister, seal and charge twice with a nitrous charger.
  - Shake, then allow to sit for 5 minutes.

      At Jalao, a Washington Heights, New York, branch of the iconic Santo Domingo restaurant, housemade mamajuana—a mix of rum, wine, honey and botanicals—stars in the bar's Mamajuana Manhattan. The making of the mamajuana itself requires steeping a proprietary blend of bark and spices for three months “to eliminate some of the bitterness of the wood,” according to bartender Jordy Castillo. That bitter liquid is disposed of and replaced with a fresh round of ingredients added to a 1-liter bottle, including a touch more honey, wine and white rum that then rests for another three weeks before being put to use in this Manhattan variation, which also calls on a small measure of Frangelico and amaretto to bolster the spiced notes. The seasoned wood can be reused several times, according to Castillo.

      "Appearing in Harry Craddock's sanctified Savoy Cocktail Book, the Jabberwock comprises equal parts gin, dry sherry and Caperitif, plus orange bitters and a lemon twist. Here, bartender Daniel Godinez puts a personal twist on the recipe. Retaining the equal part building blocks of the original, he begins with three quarters of an ounce each of dry gin and chamomile-infused manzanilla sherry. The last three-quarter-ounce measure is split evenly between Dolin Blanc vermouth, Lillet and St-Germain. This trio brings a number of distinctive traits to his version—minerality from the blanc vermouth, viscosity via the Lillet, and a floral bouquet encouraged by the elderflower liqueur. He's tinkered with the way the citrus is incorporated, too, adding the twist directly to the mixing glass and discarding it after stirring (“that just weaves the lemon into the cocktail”). Lastly, he opts to deliver the orange bitters as a punctuating spritz via an atomizer, so the aroma lingers with each sip."

      This cocktail from Dante's Naren Young “looks light, dainty and somewhat innocent, but because of the dry vermouth, it's much more austere and bone dry,” he says. Supposedly dating back to Rome in the 1950s, this riff on the Negroni alters the ratios and swaps Campari for slightly spicy Contratto Bitter and sweet vermouth for dry, making for a more complex and all-around drier cocktail. As Young puts it, “This is for the Negroni drinker that wants to be challenged.”

      “I've always said this is the best cocktail I've ever created,” says Alex Jump of her peanut butter Daiquiri, a drink she's kept in her back pocket for years after first trying something similar in Puerto Rico, tinkering with the formula every now and again. “This is kind of like my 2.0 version,” she says. In the cocktail, peanut butter-infused rum is complemented by banana liqueur. Says Jump, “It's so pleasant, it kind of tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”

      At Brooklyn's Bar Vinazo, the Basque Bamboo is a cross between the sherry classic and a spritz. The cocktail gets its name from two ingredients, a Basque blanco vermouth and a Basque cider, which put an acidic, briny, bubbly spin on the template. This Bamboo can easily be batched for a crowd; simply combine all ingredients, minus the cider, and top à la minute.

      This cold-weather-ready version of the Mojito swaps light white rum and thoughts of summer for the dark, funky rum double-team of black strap and Angostura. More richness comes from demerara simple syrup, while the Mojito's star ingredient, mint, is ditched in favor of mint-imbued, bitter Branca Menta.

  notes: |+2
      The winner of our recent Mojito tasting, Jelani Johnson typically opts for a true Cuban rum in this cocktail, preferring Havana Club 3-year-old. Knowing that that product is not readily available, he opted for two ounces of Flor de Caña 4 Year Old, along with one ounce of simple syrup and a three-quarters of an ounce of lime juice, which he likes to hand squeeze in order to get some oil from the skin into the drink. Uniquely, Johnson calls on three types of ice—cracked, cubed and crushed—which served to keep the mint in place at the bottom of the glass and prevent over-dilution of the drink. The tasting panel liked the blend of ices and the richness of the rum, and found the drink to be refreshing, crisp and cold.
  glassware: pilsner
  ingredients: 
  - 2 ounces light rum, preferably Havana Club 3 Year or Flor de Caña 4 Year
  - 1 ounce simple syrup
  - 3/4 ounce lime juice

  - "Garnish: mint bouquet"
  steps:
  - In a pilsner glass, gently muddle the mint leaves in the simple syrup.
  - Add the lime juice and rum then stir to integrate.
  - Add three cracked ice cubes and three whole ice cubes.
  - Add the soda water and gently agitate with a bar spoon to integrate ingredients.

Peter Altenburg found a better way: a riff on the Mojito he calls &thesea, batched with “mint-washed” rum and mint-infused Spanish vermouth. At the bar, the mix is pre-batched and force-carbonated; at home, this large-format recipe can be batched before serving with a topping of sparkling water."

  notes: |+2
      At New York's George Washington bar in the Freehand Hotel, Ben Rojo's Commodore Perry Cooler reads like a modern twist on the two-ingredient Japanese whisky highball. “I was inspired by the green notes in Suntory's Hakushu malt that play so prominently in their blended Toki whisky,” says Rojo of the base spirit, which he infuses with shiso leaves for added complexity. Sweetened with wasanbon, a fine-grained Japanese sugar, and bittered with a measure of yuzu juice, it manages to stretch the highball template, yet still hews closely to the spirit of the original.
  glassware: highball
  ingredients: 
  - heavy 1 1/2 ounces shiso-infused whiskey, preferably Suntory Toki
  - 1 teaspoon yuzu juice
  - 1 teaspoon wasanbon syrup (2:1, wasanbon:warm water)
  - soda water, to top
  - "Garnish: shiso leaf"
  steps:
  - Place two large ice cubes in a highball glass.
  - Add the wasanbon syrup, yuzu and whiskey.
  - Gently stir to chill the mixture.

      At Portland's Room for Improvement, the cocktails are rooted in classics but feature spins that keep the drinks feeling fresh. For the bar's Cosmopolitan, that means creating a “cranpari” cordial—cranberries blended with sugar and water, then mixed with Campari—that lends the cocktail some welcome bitter notes. Meanwhile, the blend of orange liqueurs not only adds depth of flavor, it also amps up the body of the cocktail, giving it a more rounded mouthfeel than the traditional version.

      "The breakout star of Trick Dog's Chinatown menu, released in January 2015, this “spicy bourbon citrus banger” (as owner Josh Harris describes it) was right on trend. The bar sold upward of 11,000 #5s during the menu's six-month run. The drink is typically garnished with a skewer of cilantro-infused mango cubes, but you can also use a dehydrated orange wheel and ginger candy for a similarly earthy, tart effect."

      Created by Jonas Andersen of Strøm Bar in Denmark for a Merlet Cognac competition, this drink is a play on the classic Cognac-based cocktails the French 75 and the Sidecar. Like the Sidecar, it uses an orange liqueur and lemon for its citrusy zing and Andersen's own Champagne syrup to play on the bubbly, yeasty notes of a French 75. Andersen has begun experimenting using fresh grape juice and Champagne yeast to create the syrup, but his original version uses flat Champagne (it would be heresy to use the live stuff, according to him) and sugar to create a simpler, home bar-friendly version.

      “This drink came out of multiple failures of trying to do tea well in a drink,” says Garret Richard. An avid tea drinker, Richard wanted to incorporate jasmine tea into a modern take on the Daiquiri, which he does by infusing it in milk-washed rhum that's then run through a centrifuge to clarify. The citrus component is comprised of acid-adjusted grapefruit and a pineapple syrup acts as the sweetener. “I really wanted to do something with jasmine and grapefruit—I'd seen it in a lot of perfumes but not necessarily in a lot of cocktails,” says Richard. “I've had success with jasmine and pineapple together so those two things were in the back of my mind. This drink just kind of came together from multiple loves really.”

      In this recipe, Abigail Gullo, of Loa in New Orleans, calls for Rittenhouse rye as the base and splits the vermouth portion between the sherry-based Lustau Vermut Rojo and Carpano Antica, though the typical 2:1 ratio remains intact. (Gullo typically uses La Quintinye Rouge in place of Lustau, but it can be difficult to find in certain markets). Two dashes of Angostura bitters complete the recipe, which the judges at our Manhattan blind tasting found to be pleasantly spice-forward.

      Landing on the podium at both our 2016 and 2023 Manhattan blind tastings, Joaquín Simó's recipe fractures each component in half—splitting the whiskey between Rittenhouse rye and Russell's Reserve 10-year bourbon, the sweet vermouth between Cinzano 1757 and Martelletti Classico, and the bitters between the traditional Angostura and Dale DeGroff's pimento bitters. That final flourish adds noticeable baking spice to the equation, resulting in a drink that is rich, robust and soothing in a way only a Manhattan can be.

      Acomposite of a Buck and a Whiskey Smash, this ginger-laced bourbon drink is one of Brooklyn bartender Jay Zimmerman's signatures. Instead of muddling the lemon wedges and mint leaves, he shakes the hell out of them along with a mix of bourbon and ginger juice and tops the drink with soda and Angostura bitters. If you don't have access to fresh ginger juice, you can muddle several pieces of ginger with simple syrup to achieve a spicy bite. Just adjust the ginger ratio for more or less bite.
  glassware: collins
  ingredients: 
  - 2 ounces bourbon
  - 1 ounce ginger juice, sweetened (Ba'sik uses three-parts ginger juice to one-part sugar for its sweetened ginger juice recipe. If you don't have access to fresh ginger juice, we recommend peeling and chopping a two-inch cube of fresh ginger and muddling well with 3/4 of an ounce of simple syrup in the bottom of a cocktail shaker before adding remaining ingredients.)
  - 2 lemon wedges
  - 5 mint leaves
  - 2 ounces soda water
  - 4-5 dashes Angostura bitters
  - "Garnish: mint sprig"

  - Pour Coca-Cola into a Collins glass, then pour the contents of the shaker over the cola. (The drink will fizz up, and you'll likely have three or four ounces of the alcohol and cream mixture left over. Set it aside.)
  - Place the glass in the freezer for three minutes.
  - Remove the glass from the freezer. Use a straw to poke a hole in the middle of the drink, then pull it out. If excess bubbles cling to the straw, put the drink back in the freezer for a couple of minutes, and repeat the process.
  - Swirl the mixing tin containing the remaining the alcohol and cream mixture to stir the contents. Pour the contents into the glass, through the hole made with the straw. The meringue top should rise above the glass like a soufflé.

This Ramos adds other accents to the fizz template, too, like the vanilla-forward Spanish liqueur Licor 43 and génépy, which, with its bracing gentian flavor, further cements this spiked Limonada Suiça as a winter-appropriate drink.

      In 1965, New Mexican restaurant owner Arturo Jaramillo created this seasonal take on the Margarita for his restaurant Rancho de Chimayó, calling on apple cider to complement the tequila base. Our modern spin hews closely to the original, with the addition of a small measure of ginger beer to lengthen the drink and bring some added zip and dimension. For those who prefer the drink served up, try subbing in a quarter-ounce of ginger syrup in lieu of the ginger beer.

      One of the ways in which Fanny Chu reinforces the escapist atmosphere of Donna is by creating cocktails that directly evoke a particular place. Her Nog Nog Noggin' on Heaven's Door draws on the flavor profile of Crema Catalana (“one of my faves,” she says), a custard-like Spanish dessert that she encountered while traveling through Catalonia with her fiancée. To translate it into drink form, Chu builds on a whiskey base complemented by Cognac, Cachaça, orange liqueur, cinnamon syrup, cream and eggs and serves it from Donna's slushy machine.

      San Francisco's 15 Romolo is housed in a building erected in 1912, which served as a Basque family restaurant from the 1940s until the 1990s. Neighbors that once frequented the restaurant will stop into 15 Romolo for a Picon Punch, known as “the National drink of the Basques,” which is based on the obscure French orange bitter, Amer Picon. Because Amer Picon is no longer commercially available, bartender Andrew Meltzer created his own version using Ramazzotti amaro, orange curaçao and gentian liqueur.

Amontillado sherry is salty, nutty—they work really nicely together.” A small measure of Paranubes Oaxacan agricole rum adds a “green grassy note,” says Bermudez, underscoring the tropical through-line of this drink.

  notes: |+2
      “Every family has their own version” of this creamy, spiced, rum-based drink with Puerto Rican roots, often enjoyed around the winter holidays, says LyAnna Sanabria. Her version starts with a toasted spice coconut syrup, which is then enriched with a mixture of  coconut milk, coconut cream, evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk. In the spirit of coquito, which is meant to be shared, this recipe makes enough for several gatherings. As Sanabria suggests, keep a bottle for yourself and gift the rest to a few lucky friends. While this recipe calls for mixing the rum into the coquito, the base can also be kept nonalcoholic, with the option of spiking individual servings by adding 1 1/2 ounces of rum to a 5-ounce pour of coquito mix. Sanabria typically recommends Puerto Rican rum, but adding blackstrap can add “a rich baking spice note,” she says. Yields approximately six 750-mL bottles.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 2 14-ounce cans coconut milk
  - 2 14-ounce cans evaporated milk
  - 2 14-ounce cans sweetened condensed milk
  - 15-ounce can coconut cream
  - toasted spice coconut syrup (see Editor's Note, use entire quantity made)
  - 1/2 ounce Angostura bitters
  - large pinch of sea salt, preferably Himalayan (“no more than a teaspoon,” Sanabria says)
  - 750-milliliter bottle white Puerto Rican rum, preferably Palo Viejo, Don Q, Ron del Barrilito or Cruzan Blackstrap
  - "Garnish: grated nutmeg and/or cinnamon"
  steps:
  - In a blender, combine the coconut milk, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and coconut cream. Blend until frothy.
  - Pour the toasted spice coconut syrup into a separate container that is large enough to hold the final volume. (Sanabria suggests a mixing bowl or bulk container that holds 8 quarts, such as a Cambro.)
  - Pour the blended mixture into the container with the syrup, and whisk until incorporated. Add the Angostura bitters, salt and the spices reserved from the syrup, then stir to combine.
  - Cover and refrigerate overnight.
  - The next day, stir in the rum, and decant into six empty 750-milliliter rum bottles. Keeps, refrigerated, for 4 to 6 weeks.
  - To serve, pour 4 ounces into a glass (either stemmed or a rocks glass, but no ice). Garnish with grated nutmeg and/or cinnamon. For a little nip or a communal toast, serve in shot glasses.

      America's love affair with the Negroni is quickly spreading to the furthest reaches of America, from the deep, dark crimson of the Kingston Negroni to perfectly clear Polka Dot Negroni. It appears at chef Paul Kahan's newest venture, Nico Osteria, in Chicago, with bartender Matty Eggleston's amaro-laden riff. Eggleston mixes London dry Sipsmith Gin and bittersweet Cocchi Americano (both of which he keeps chilled for an extra-icy drink), as well as herbal Amaro Braulio and sparkling mineral water.

      Like all good stories should, the one about the Negroni‘s origin involves rakish Italian nobility. Most accounts credit the recipe to one Count Negroni, a swashbuckling proto-boho who reportedly spent time as a rodeo cowboy in the United States. Compounding his wild ways, legend has it that back at a bar in Italy in 1919, he asked for a something like an Americano, but boozier. Swap gin for soda water, and presto, the Negroni. This version switches traditional sweet vermouth for Dolin Blanc, a sweet white vermouth, and instead of the bitter twang of Campari, Maloney uses a gentian apéritif wine and grapefruit bitters.

Served in a chilled Nick & Nora glass with a fresh grating of nutmeg, his recipe was found to be the archetypal example of a traditional eggnog in our blind tasting, with a creamy texture that still felt light and almost fluffy, underscored by a detectable boozy backbone.

      Serves 8.

  - Whisk the yolks and sugar together until they firm up and their bright orange color fades to a more opaque pale yellow.
  - Slowly add the spirits, milk and cream while continuing to whisk air into the batch.
  - Beat the egg whites and salt together to stiff peaks.
  - Whisk the egg whites into the mixture.

The term “Maria mole” can also refer to something soft or without structure, which likely influenced the cocktail’s name, reflecting its smooth and velvety texture.

    The eponymous sour at Los Angeles’ Capri Club varies by the season. The bright, bittersweet cocktail is always made with mezcal and Amaro Meletti as the base, but the bar uses different “house red bitter blends” that mix options like Contratto Bitter, Bordiga Bitter, Tuvè Bitter and more. This ingredient is used across multiple drinks, from the Capri Sour to the bar’s boilermaker, in which the red blend subs in for Campari in a 50/50 Ferrari shot. At home, Campari or your own red bitter blend works just as well.

    Taking top honors at our 2024 Sazerac blind tasting, this recipe adheres to the traditional rye (rather than Cognac) version of the drink. It’s made by filling a rocks glass halfway with crushed ice and a quarter-ounce of Herbsaint, rolling it to coat the interior of the glass, then dumping the crushed ice from the glass, ensuring a little bit of Herbsaint is left behind. The rest of the ingredients are stirred with ice in a mixing glass and strained into the prepared rocks glass, then garnished with a lemon twist.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 1/4 ounce Herbsaint, for rinsing the glass
  - 2 ounces rye, preferably Rye & Sons
  - 1/4 ounce rich cane syrup (2:1, cane sugar to water)
  - 6 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
  - 1 dash Angostura bitters
  - "Garnish: lemon peel"
  steps:
  - Fill a rocks glass halfway with crushed ice and add the Herbsaint.
  - Roll the glass a little to cover the whole inside of the glass with Herbsaint. Stir, then dump out the crushed ice and Herbsaint from the glass, making sure to leave just a little Herbsaint behind.
  - Add the rest of the ingredients to a mixing glass and stir with ice.
  - Strain the drink into the prepared glass and garnish with a lemon peel.

    Second place in our 2024 Sazerac blind tasting went to this version, appropriately hailing from the birth city of the drink. At New Orleans’ Cure, the evolution of the house Sazerac began well before the bar opened in 2009.

    For precision and consistency, Cure relies on drops from a medicine dropper instead of dashes, which can vary based on the dasher opening and fullness of the bottle. Specifically, they landed on 23 drops, roughly the equivalent of three dashes.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 4 sptizes Herbsaint, from an atomizer
  - 2 ounces rye, preferably Sazerac
  - 1/4 ounce rich Demerara syrup (2:1, Demerara sugar to water)
  - 23 drops (3 dashes) Peychaud’s bitters
  - "Garnish: lemon peel"
  steps:
  - Spritz the Herbsaint from an atomizer into the interior of a chilled double Old-Fashioned glass.
  - Combine the rye, Demerara syrup and bitters in a mixing glass filled with ice and stir to chill.
  - Strain into the prepared glass.
  - Garnish with the lemon peel.

    Taking the third spot in our 2024 Sazerac blind tasting, this recipe from Fives Bar, a relative newcomer to the New Orleans cocktail bar scene, builds on a base of Wild Turkey 101 rye (ordered in situ, the rye is fat-washed with bone marrow). A rich cane syrup and two types of bitters—the expected Peychaud’s and Angostura—round out the drink, which is served in an Herbsaint-coated glass. All the judges commented on the rich body of this version, with one taster observing that “it has some weight to it, it’s velvety—it doesn’t have the density of water.”
  glassware: 
  ingredients: 
  - Herbsaint, for rinsing glass
  - 2 ounces rye, preferably Wild Turkey 101
  - 1/4 ounce rich cane sugar syrup (2:1, cane sugar to water, preferably made with unrefined Louisiana cane sugar)
  - 5 dashes Peychaud’s bitters
  - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
  - "Garnish: lemon peel"
  steps:
  - Generously coat the inside of a frozen rocks glass with the Herbsaint.
  - Combine the remaining ingredients in a mixing glass.
  - Stir with Kold-Draft or similar cubes, being careful not to overdilute, then strain into the prepared glass.
  - Express a lemon twist and drop it into the cocktail.

    Tallboy in Oakland, California, has a full menu of “craft cheekies”—mini cocktails, dispensed from freezer bottles into shot glasses. Of those diminutive drinks, the top seller is the Mezzymeister, a 50/50 combination of Jägermeister and mezcal “with a splash of water in each batch to soften the sharp edges,” says the bar’s owner, Den Stephens. “That combination of herbal and smoky makes it a distant cousin to, say, a mezcal Last Word or a Naked & Famous.”

    The team behind Plus de Vin were fans of the M&M, but wanted to add “a more delicate beverage” to their list, says Carenn Mackinnon, a partner at the Brooklyn wine bar. In place of Montenegro, Forthave Spirits’ Marseille offers more orange and rose aromatics, she says. And rather than a 1:1 ratio, this pairing is closer to 5:4 (amaro to mezcal); “This also makes it feel more like a sipper, rather than a shot.” The wine bar keeps the shot batched in the fridge and sometimes serves it with an orange twist garnish.

    Pete St. Peter, at Capri Club in Los Angeles, decided to play up two smoky spirits for her take on the 50/50. The Affumicato combines Agua del Sol mezcal (“a real heavy smoky mezcal”) with Amaro Sfumato Rabarbaro, a fruity, smoky amaro that “brings its own funk to the table,” she says. Capri Club serves this pairing as a shot, but also spotlights the classic M&M in cocktails like the Capri Sour.

    At Roma Norte, a Mexico City–inspired bar in San Diego, the Rosita swaps the expected reposado tequila for a brighter blanco expression. In keeping with this lighter play on the modern classic, the citrus-forward Mommenpop Ruby Grapefruit aperitif subs in for sweet vermouth, rounded out by blanc vermouth and Campari with its trademark bitterness. Rather than serve it on the rocks, the bar opts for an elegant coupe, garnished with a grapefruit twist.

As Kehagiaras explains, he focuses “on micro quantities of potent spirits and liqueurs to make loud impact.” Here, a small measure of green Chartreuse boosts the herbal complexity found in the base of St. George Spirits Terroir Gin, which is lengthened by blanc vermouth for body and just the right amount of sweetness.

    While Bryant’s has no written menu (guests instead discuss what they’d like with the bartender), the iconic lounge—the oldest in the state—offers many Midwestern staples, like the Pink Squirrel and this Wisconsin Old-Fashioned. The drink arrives in a footed glass topped with soda—exactly which soda will depend on whether it’s ordered “sweet,” “sour” or “press”—garnished with a cherry and orange half-moon. Like just about everything at Bryant’s, our Industry Icon of 2024, it manages to feel like it has equal footing in the past and the present.

    For a “sweet” Old-Fashioned, use white soda, like Sprite or 7Up; for “sour,” use a grapefruit soda, like Squirt; for “press,” use seltzer water or half seltzer, half white soda.
  glassware: 
  ingredients: 
  - 1/2 ounce simple syrup
  - 5 dashes Angostura bitters
  - 4 ounces soda, divided (see Editor’s Note)
  - 2 ounces brandy
  - "Garnish: cherry and orange half-moon"
  steps:
  - In a 12-ounce footed Old-Fashioned glass, add the simple syrup, Angostura bitters and an ounce of soda.
  - Swirl these around the glass, allowing the ingredients to mix, creating a light foam. You should be able to smell the bitters.
  - Add the brandy, fill with ice and top with the remaining soda.
  - Garnish with a cherry and orange half-moon.

    Yanni Kehagiaras’ sherry-based aperitif was inspired by the “notion of being on a raft off the coast of a tropical island.” The dryness of the manzanilla suggests a sea spray of sorts, amplified by actual salt in the Velvet Falernum. A splash of green Chartreuse “brings a subtle vegetal accent, which acts as the seaweed” in this enticing ode to the sea.

    “The purpose of this drink was to showcase some of the unique flavors that are enjoyed in the Upper Midwest while still being a very classic-feeling daisy-style cocktail,” says Jackson Mercier, head bartender at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee. Crème de noyaux—which also stars in the Pink Squirrel, an iconic ice cream cocktail originating at Bryant’s—teams up with Trinidadian rum and brandy, the state spirit of Wisconsin. (For the latter, Mercier suggests using Korbel, if you’re not feeling fancy.) “The split base between a dry Trinidadian rum blend and a sweeter American-style brandy provides a sort of high-low [quality],” says Mercier. Lime juice, vanilla syrup and a dash of peach bitters complete the drink, which takes its name from the Milwaukee term for a traffic light.
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 3/4 ounce Trinidadian rum, preferably Scarlet Ibis

    Though John Dye, who’s owned the venerated Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge since 2008, doesn’t have any hard evidence backing up the belief that The Pink Squirrel was invented at his 86-year-old Milwaukee bar, he feels confident sharing this origin story anecdotally, based on his numerous conversations with old-timers over the years. Built upon a sweet split of crème de noyaux and crème de cacao that produces a pleasantly rosy hue, the Squirrel might be the rare cream-based cocktail that was originally made with ice cream in lieu of heavy cream.

  notes: |+2
    Since the early days of the cocktail revival, the Amaretto Sour has been regarded as nothing more than the butt of a joke. In fact, the widespread ridicule of the liqueur and sour mix-based drink quickly became a banner cause for the movement, which was defined by fresh ingredients and a rejection of any cocktail created after 1950. For Jeffrey Morgenthaler, the blanket derision of what was once “just a drink that nobody had an opinion on,” never sat well with him. His revamped version adds a measure of overproof bourbon for backbone, while just the right amount of egg white adds the desired texture. This whiskey-inflected take is now often considered a modern classic.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 1 1/2 ounces amaretto, preferably Luxardo

    Taking the third spot in our Amaretto Sour blind tasting, this recipe, on paper, was the most finicky of the bunch. It calls for one and a quarter ounces of Lazzaroni amaretto, half an ounce of Wild Turkey 101 bourbon, a quarter-ounce of amontillado sherry, plus both lemon and lime juices, Demerara syrup, hazelnut oil, salt tincture and an egg white. The finishing touch was a spray of black walnut bitters over the surface of the drink.

    Inspired by the Amaretto Sour served at New York’s now-closed NoMad Bar, a small measure of Campari finds its way into the classic served at Brooklyn’s Grand Army. It might sound unorthodox on paper, but the tweak is designed to be almost imperceptible, offering just enough bitterness to cut the inherent sweetness of amaretto.

  - Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker and dry-shake without ice.

    The first drink Alec Bales landed on the Ticonderoga Club menu, the More Supreme hews closely to the Daiquiri blueprint, but opts for a base of aged rhum agricole for a rich, almost savory rendition. A quarter-ounce of Campari sunk to the bottom of the cocktail offers an unexpected last sip. “The idea was, if I had to have one cocktail right before eating a meal and I couldn’t decide between a Daiquiri and a Negroni,” says Bales.

    At Cobra, in Columbus, Ohio, the Broth Back is the most popular boilermaker on the menu. Consisting of a shot of whisky and a side of hot broth inspired by Maruchan Ramen packets, it’s a surprising, yet nostalgic pairing. “Our kitchen is the last fresh-food option open in Columbus most nights, so naturally we are the last stop for people having a night out and industry folk,” according to Alex Chien, Kayla LeRoy and David Yee, who make up the bar team. Late nights plus an industry-heavy crowd mean lots of boilermakers. Here is the recipe for the broth; Cobra pairs it with Dewar’s White Label Scotch.

    Yields 6 quarts.
  glassware: n/a
  ingredients: 
  - 3/4 pound dried shiitake
  - 1 yellow onion, peeled and halved
  - 1 cup whole garlic cloves, peeled
  - 1 cup soy sauce
  - 1/2 cup mustard seeds
  - 1-inch knob fresh ginger
  - 4 cinnamon sticks
  - 4 star anise pods
  - 12 grams MSG
  - 6 quarts cold water
  steps:
  - Combine all ingredients in an appropriately sized stockpot. Add the cold water and slowly bring up to a bare simmer over medium heat.
  - Reduce to the lowest possible heat and allow the broth to steep for 3 hours. Let cool, then strain and serve.

    “Ahighball seems simple, but to make a really good one is calculated,” says Kenta Goto, owner of New York’s Bar Goto and Bar Goto Niban. His preferred recipe for the Japanese classic calls for a slightly dialed-back amount of whisky, and he specifies that measuring the 4 ounces of soda, rather than eyeballing, is important to pair with a whisky between 40 and 44 percent ABV. “ If a customer requests a highball made with a whisky with higher ABV, we tweak the ratio to 1 ounce to 4 ounces to keep the right balance in the drink,” he says.

    At Maison Premiere, the Chrysanthemum is a highly aromatic mix of La Quintinye Blanc vermouth fortified with small measures of Bénédictine, absinthe and bitters. A low-proof classic from the early 20th century, it’s one of those “better than the sum of its parts” cocktails that’s simpler in its build than its profile would suggest. “Not to be outdone (like, ever) on garnishes, Maison recommends crowning the drink with a fresh snapdragon, but it’ll be just as good without the extra frill,” says Punch art director Lizzie Munro.

    At the reimagined Upper East Side bistro Le Veau d’Or—New York’s oldest French bistro—Sarah Morrissey has created a Martini for the ages. An austere combination of high-proof Old Raj gin alongside González Byass’ fino sherry–based La Copa Extra Seco vermouth and four dashes of orange bitters in a 5:1 ratio, this is a true gin lover’s Martini. The Old Raj and La Copa together are a savory match, and yield an especially dry Martini that gets an aromatic lift by way of the bitters, which are an all too frequent omission in the modern Martini. Here, they are essential. To top it off, Morrissey serves the drink with a highball “sidecar” that consists of the leftover, ginny “dirty ice” and an additional dose of the La Copa vermouth, topped with the exceptionally salty Spanish mineral water Vichy Catalan, and, finally, a lemon peel.
  glassware: martini
  ingredients: 
  - 2 1/2 ounces Old Raj 110-proof gin
  - 1/2 ounce González Byass La Copa Extra Seco fino sherry vermouth
  - 2 dashes Angostura orange bitters
  -2 dashes Regans’ orange bitters
  - "Garnish: lemon twist, expressed and reserved for the Salty Vermouth sidecar"
  steps:
  - Add gin, vermouth and orange bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice.

    At the French bistro Le Veau d’Or, Sarah Morrissey serves this spin on the French tradition of Trou Normand, or “Norman hole.” Typically consisting of a chilled shot of the French apple brandy Calvados—or sometimes Calvados-soaked apple sorbet—the tradition is designed to make space, or a “hole,” for more courses, toeing the line between excessive and epicurean. Morrissey opts, instead, for blanche Armagnac, an unaged grape spirit—kept in the freezer for a rich texture—in place of Calvados, paired with fresh-pressed Granny Smith apple juice.

At Quattro Teste, a bar in Lisbon, Portugal, themed around Basque and Italian drinks, the Bombardino gets a Basque twist: The bar makes its own egg liqueur, with txakoli-based vermouth and amontillado sherry, which is then spiked with Scotch and topped with salted cream as well as freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon.

  - In separate containers in a sous vide or hot water bath, warm the Scotch and egg liqueur to 140°F (60°C) before preparing the drink.
  - Pour the whisky into a glass. (Quattro Teste uses a 200-milliliter footed flute.)

    Originally published in The Savoy Cocktail Book in 1930, the Rolls Royce is essentially a perfect Martini accented with Bénédictine. At Tigre in New York, William Elliott’s version is a top seller, despite being an old-timer on a mostly 1970s-inspired menu. The expected London dry gin and a barrel-aged, apple-based expression together form the base, which is layered with a moscato chinato in place of the two vermouths, plus Bénédictine, saffron liqueur, orange bitters and expressed lemon oil. Elliott revived his somewhat controversial up-rocks presentation for this drink, both for the added dilution and for its aesthetic similarity to a grand old Rolls.

Outside of this cocktail, Bryce says the Lucano syrup would work nicely in any Old-Fashioned-style drink, particularly alongside Scotch or rye.

    At Jaffa Bar, Sean Bryce has created several amaro syrups, including Cynar syrup, to add a bittersweet kick to his cocktails. “With this one, I’m essentially making vermouth,” he says. By blending Cynar with sour cherry juice, sugar, vanilla extract and cardamom, he developed a less-sweet alternative to the fortified wine. The result is something akin to Punt e Mes, he says, with “a more herbal taste.” He shakes this in equal parts with rye and Cognac, plus two barspoons of Bonal for a spirit-forward drink with layers of bittersweet complexity. 
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 1 ounce rye, such as Dickel
  - 1 ounce Cognac, such as Martell
  - 1 ounce Cynar Syrup
  - 2 barspoons Bonal
  - arak, to rinse the glass
  - "Garnish: orange twist (expressed and discarded)"
  steps:
  - Rinse a rocks glass with arak, then set aside.
  - Combine remaining ingredients in a mixing glass with ice and stir until properly chilled and diluted.
  - Strain into the prepared glass over fresh ice.
  - Garnish with an orange twist expressed over the surface of the drink, then discard.

     Rabo de Galo first became popular in the mid-1950s when the Italian vermouth producer Cinzano opened a factory in bustling São Paulo. To compete with the ubiquitous consumption of cachaça, the native spirit, in local bars, the company introduced a foreign concept to Brazil: mixing two alcoholic bases in the same glass and calling it a “cocktail.” However, the practice took off only after they decided to translate the word. In Portuguese, galo means “rooster” (or “cock”), and rabo means “tail.”
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - Scant 1 3/4 ounces aged cachaça
  - Scant 3/4 ounce sweet vermouth, preferably Vermouth Carpano Classico
  - Heavy 1/4 ounce Cynar
  - "Garnish: lime twist"
  steps:
  - Pour the cachaça, vermouth and Cynar into a mixing glass with ice and stir until chilled.
  - Strain into a rocks glass with ice.
  - Garnish with a lime twist.

    Coating the interior of the glass with a particularly aromatic spirit before the drink is poured means extra fragrance even before the glass is lifted for a sip. (Plus, it adds a little extra flavor, and proof, to the finished cocktail.) While absinthe is usually the go-to rinsing agent, at San Antonio’s Juniper Tar, caraway-accented kümmel adds extra aroma to a vodka-based variation on the classic Tuxedo, eventually melding into the drink and creating the effect of a spiced gin, hold the juniper.
  glassware: nick & nora
  ingredients: 
  - kümmel rinse
  - 2 ounces vodka
  - 1/2 ounce dry vermouth
  - 1/2 ounce fino sherry
  - 1 dash orange bitters
  - "Garnish: demitasse spoon of caviar (optional)"
  steps:
  - Pour the kümmel into a Nick & Nora glass.
  - Swirl to coat the interior, then pour out the excess liquid and set aside.
  - Combine the remaining ingredients in a mixing glass over ice and stir until chilled.
  - Strain into the prepared glass.
  - Serve with a demitasse spoon of caviar on the side.

    “Ihad never thought of Scotch and gin as such an agreeable flavor duo until stumbling across Michael Madrusan’s Death & Taxes cocktail, which was an enlightening blend of robust and malty flavors of blended Scotch rounding out the sharp, botanical edges of a London dry gin,” says New York bar director Brian Evans. Today, Evans’ favorite hack for adding depth to a Negroni is to add a half-teaspoon of Islay Scotch. It’s a technique used in a complex riff, the Hashira, at Rule of Thirds, but it also works in a more classic build like this, too.
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 1 ounce London dry gin
  - 3/4 ounce Campari
  - 3/4 ounce sweet vermouth, preferably Cocchi di Torino
  - 1/2 teaspoon (about 4 dashes) Islay Scotch

    At Sip—one half of the bi-level New York bar Sip & Guzzle—the Sixty Forty is designed to channel a Martini when ice-cold, then a Manhattan as it settles. It calls on gin and whiskey, both dry and sweet vermouths, and, as an accent to the drink, Seedlip Spice and Seedlip Garden, two N/A spirits.

  - 2 ounces gin, such as Bombay Sapphire
  - 1/3 ounce rye whiskey, such as Rittenhouse

  notes: |+2
    Coffee With Giuseppe takes inspiration from Chicago bartender Stephen Cole’s Bitter Giuseppe, a modern amaro classic made with Cynar, sweet vermouth, lemon and orange bitters. When stirring the drink, Williams Pierce recommends keeping your nonstirring hand on the mixing glass and stirring until you feel the chill of the glass. “You’re looking for chill as well as dilution here, but since the drink is also going over ice, you don’t want it to be too diluted,” she says.
  glassware: rocks
  ingredients: 
  - 3/4 ounce Du Nord Café Frieda Coffee Liqueur
  - 3/4 ounce Cynar
  - 3/4 ounce Cocchi Vermouth di Torino
  - 1/4 ounce fresh lemon juice
  - 2 dashes Angostura Orange bitters
  - 4 drops drops saline solution (4:1)
  - "Garnish: horses's neck orange twist"
  steps:
  - Combine ingredients in a mixing glass with ice.
  - Stir for 10 to 15 seconds to chill, then strain into a chilled rocks glass over ice.
  - Garnish with a super long orange twist.

    “Iuse Batavia arrack like a spice,” says Guillermo Bravo, formerly of New York’s The NoMad Bar. “It succeeds greatly in small amounts if the cocktail is subtle. [And] if the cocktail has a lot of character, Batavia arrack can provide a heavier underlying palate.”

    In this cocktail, it does the latter, supplying a funky foundation for pear brandy and sherry, whose warmth is complemented by spicy cinnamon syrup and tart citrus. The result takes what could be a “bright, summery” drink and transforms it into something warm and fortifying for the winter.
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 1 ounce Batavia arrack
  - 3/4 ounce oloroso sherry, preferably Lustau
  - 1/2 ounce pear brandy, preferably Clear Creek Williams
  - 3/4 ounce fresh lime juice
  - 1/2 ounce grapefruit juice
  - 1/2 ounce orgeat
  - 1/4 ounce cinnamon syrup

    At the contemporary Vietnamese restaurant Moon Rabbit in Washington, D.C., tofu is a staple of the kitchen. Thi Nguyen, the restaurant’s bar director and one of our Best New Bartenders of 2024, turns the tofu whey—the liquid in a container that’s typically discarded—into an easy-to-make simple syrup. The sweetener is used throughout the bar, and here, it’s part of a tofu soup–inspired cocktail from a pop-up at New York’s Bangkok Supper Club.
  glassware: coupe
  ingredients: 
  - 1 1/2 ounces Chive-Infused Rum
  - 3/4 ounce lime juice
  - 3/4 ounce Tofu Whey Syrup
  - 2 to 3 drops of umami bitters
  - "Garnish: chive bud"
  steps:
  - Add all ingredients to a shaker with ice and shake until chilled.
  - Double strain into a coupe glass.

    At San Francisco’s Quince, where Bar Agricole is in residence, overseeing the bar program, the Japanese Cocktail is a standout. Thad Vogler uses Bar Agricole’s own biodynamic California brandy, a blend of barrels aged 8 to 15 years, for the base, complemented by housemade orgeat and aromatic bitters. The farm that grows the grapes for the brandy and for the high-proof spirit that stabilizes the bitters is the same one that grows the almonds that go into the orgeat. “So it’s a single-estate, grower-producer cocktail,” says Vogler.
