      Two types of sotol—aged and unaged—create a complex base in this recipe from Rules & Regs in Austin. “Cantaloupe juice lengthens the cocktail and plays into the tropical notes of the sotol, while the lime and agave nectar balance it out with acidity and sweetness,” says bartender Chloe Fisher.
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 3/4 oz. unaged sotol
    - 3/4 oz. añejo sotol 
    - 1/2 oz. yellow Chartreuse
    - 1 oz. cantaloupe juice
    - 1/2 oz. fresh lime juice
    - 1/4 oz. agave nectar
    - "Garnish: cantaloupe on a pick dusted with tajin"
    steps:
    - Add all the ingredients to a shaker, fill with ice and shake vigorously. 
    - Strain into a rocks glass, fill with crushed ice and garnish.

      Leo Robitschek, beverage director of Brooklyn's rooftop bar elNico, found inspiration for his Cantaloupe Paloma during a trip to Spain. Who knew a simple salad with cantaloupe and jamón ibérico “that was surprisingly fresh and delicious” would resonate as much as it did? “When I got back home, I started playing with mezcal and cantaloupe, creating the Paloma,” Robitschek says. He captures the essence of summer by using cantaloupe juice and the soft floral notes from jasmine-infused agave syrup.
    glassware: collins
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz. Los 7 Misterios Doba Yej mezcal
    - 3/4 oz. Jasmine-Infused Agave syrup.
    - 3/4 oz. lemon juice
    - 1 1/2 oz. cantaloupe juice
    - 5 oz. club soda
    steps:
    - Salt the rim of a glass, fill with ice, and set aside. 
    - In a shaker, combine all of the ingredients except the club soda, add ice, then shake vigorously. 
    - Add the club soda to the shaker, then pour the cocktail into the prepared glass.

      “The squeaky wheel gets the oil, my father always used to tell me. This cocktail demands that level of attention,” says Nicholas Bennett of Cedric's at the Shed of this Mezcal Negroni. “I enjoy the combination of coffee and bitters, and I will occasionally add a touch of Angostura to my coffee in the morning, so the blend of St. George NOLA Coffee Liqueur and Campari was almost a no-brainer when I was developing this Negroni variation. The splash of amaretto really rounds out the cocktail.”
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 oz. Mezcal
    - 1 oz. Campari
    - 3/4 oz. coffee Liqueur
    - 1/4 oz. amaretto
    - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
    - "Garnish: orange twist"
    steps:
    - Stir all the ingredients together in a mixing tin with ice, then strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.
    - Express the oils of the orange peel over the top of the drink and use as a garnish.

      As with other drinks at Stoa, small amounts of accent ingredients serve to highlight the flavor of the cocktail’s base (in this case, the crisp dryness of manzanilla sherry). At home, remember that 2 ml is just shy of a 1/2 teaspoon.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 2 oz. manzanilla sherry
    - 1/4 oz. Bénédictine
    - 2 ml (just shy of 1/2 tsp) peated single malt Scotch whisky (Stoa uses Ardbeg Wee Beastie)
    steps:
    - Stir all of the ingredients with ice, then strain into a chilled glass.

      Likening this cocktail to a dry Irish whiskey Manhattan, Yanni Kehagiaras notes that the drink should be stirred very briefly with ice. “It’s about retaining the texture and viscosity,” says Kehagiaras, co-owner of Stoa in San Francisco, one of this year’s Imbibe 75 Places to Watch. “Just a brief chill and it’s good.”
    glassware: rocks
    ingredients:
    - 1 1/2 oz. Irish whiskey (Stoa uses Powers)
    - 1/2 oz. dry vermouth (such as Dolin)
    - 1/2 oz. coffee liqueur (Stoa uses St. George Spirits NOLA Coffee Liqueur) 
    steps:
    - Combine all of the ingredients with ice and stir very briefly, only for 5 seconds or so. 
    - Strain into the glass and serve.
