      Pisco is ideal for a juicy, fresh sour. I like dry vermouth for herbaceousness, green apple for brightness, Boston Bittahs for a high note. Macadamia syrup subtly balances the acidity and lends a silky texture.

    - 2 DASHES Bittermens Boston Bittahs
    - 0.75 OZ Lemon juice
    - 0.5 OZ Granny Smith Apple Juice

    - 0.5 OZ Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth
    - 1.5 OZ Waqar Pisco

      This is a cocktail made with a spirit base that mimics a mimosa. The light, citrusy Hibiki and sherbet complement the Asian note of the sesame-infused Irish whiskey. I added lemon to boost the acidic citrus. Suze is for complexity and bitterness and adds an almost marmalade quality.
    glassware: flute
    ingredients:
    - 1 OZ Champagne (not to be shaken with other ingredients)
    - 1 TSP Honey Syrup
    - 0.5 OZ Suze
    - 0.75 OZ Lemon juice
    - 0.75 OZ Orange Sherbet
    - 0.5 OZ Sesame-Infused Powers Gold Irish Whiskey
    - 1.5 OZ Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky
    steps:
    - Add Champagne to the flute.
    - Shake the remaining ingredients with ice, then fine-strain into the glass with Champagne.
    - Serve up without ice.

      At the time, I was very interested in nut and seed syrups and was playing with ones that weren't commonly used in drinks. I settled on sunflower seeds and made them into a really tasty orgeat. From there, I based the cocktail around the flavor set of sunflower, coriander, and orange.

    - 2 DASHES Dale DeGroff's Pimento Bitters
    - 0.75 OZ Lemon juice

    - 0.5 OZ Teeling Small Batch Irish Whiskey
    - 1.5 OZ Coriander-Infused Glenmorangie Original
    - 1.5 OZ Soda water (not to be shaken with other ingredients)
    steps:
    - Dry shake.
    - Add ice and shake for a long time.
    - Add soda water to the highball glass.

      This drink came to me in a dream, in which I was alone in the parlor making an incredible cocktail. The cocktail was made with black pepper, blackberry and Black Grouse Scotch. I remember naming it the Black Black Black Grouse. When I got to work, I made the drink and it got onto the menu. The original name didn't.

      Think boozy cinnamon Christmas cookies for this one. The rum is split with the cachaça for a bit of funk and extra layers. Becherovka is a Czech herbal liqueur with a strong cinnamon note that's pretty cool.
    glassware: nick & nora
    ingredients:
    - 0.5 TSP Cane Syrup
    - 0.5 OZ Yellow Chartreuse

      This drink started with a challenge - balancing the aggressive flavors of peat with a heavy Scotch base and formatting that into an approachable old-fashioned variation. The profile that inspired the drink was lapsang-smoked black tea.

      A breakfast cocktail in the style of a flip. The unaged oat whiskey and malt whiskey represent the oatmeal, the port, the berry, and so on. A whole egg made it more like a dessert drink than a breakfast drink, but the combo works beautifully.

    - 1 DASH Angostura Bitters

      I'm the sherry fanatic around here and was interested in putting a few lower-proof ABV cocktails on the list. This is a clean, bright sherry cobbler with a hint of spice and gentain, lavishly garnished with blueberries and mace powder.

      A real crowd-pleaser, Spark Plug looks simpler than it is. The flavor pairings of passion fruit, vanilla, lemon and green apple all intertwine at some point. The delicacy of the Botanist doesn't overpower the modifiers and lets the gin shine. Lemongrass adds a touch of brightness of dryness.

      A margarita-style drink, sweetened with orgeat instead of agave for more layers. It still needed something to make it more special. To add to the greenness, green tea was suggested, then the magic funky rum bump made it all come together.

      An attempt to recreate salted caramel popcorn. Montreuil Calvados Selection always reminded me of buttered popcorn, so I started there. Pommeau's funky fermented apple quality brings a quirkiness, and applewood salt lends a smoky note. Pimento bitters enhance this and balance the caramel sweetness.

      This got dreamed up after falling in love with a new spirit I'd discovered - an unaged apple distillate. It was fresh, bright and minerally fragrant. I immediately thought of a martini - and it developed into this.

      This is inspired by a drink I'd done in the past, but which I felt I could improve. I switched out the original sweetener, changed the flavor of preserves from marmalade to kumquat and added a small amount of Strega for depth and some anise to complement the sage.

    - 1 barspoon kumquat preserves

      The idea here was a slightly spicy, stirred agave cocktail. It's common to see these flavors in a citrus-forward, shaken drink but not so much in this format. With a habanero shrub to spice it, I based the rest of the flavors around that.

      I based this drink around avocado. Since avocado is such a delicate flavor, I incorporated it in the drink in two ways - a fat wash and a rich cane syrup. Once I figured out how to get the avocado flavor right, the drink came together naturally.

      I wanted to do a Scotch-based White Negroni variation. I really love the green apple and other bright fruit notes of Glenfiddich, which led me to modifiers of an apple liqueur made in upstate New York and absinthe, while keeping the classic Suze and Cocchi of a white negroni.

      I wanted an approachable yet complex cocktail where the star was beer. Belgian-style beers have a bright fruit, cloves, anise and herb-like quality.

      Olive oil-washed mezcal was the starting point; the other ingredients were added to accentuate that. The corn whiskey downplays the smokiness of the mezcal, and the chipotle adds dark, vegetal, spicy aromatics. Sumac's tart floral aromatics were paired with the tomato. The result is smoky and spicy yet light and refreshing.

      A friend challenged me to come up with a drink using an herb called lime basil. I couldn't track down a reliable supply of lime basil, but I found that fresh basil and kaffir lime leaves mimicked it quite closely. I wanted to pursue an Asian theme for this cocktail and ended up with a delicate Japanese Whisky Sour variation, with rice milk standing in for an egg white.

      I wanted to base a martini variation around the cinnamon and citrus botanical makeup of Perry's Tot Navy Strength Gin.

      I wanted a Martini-style stirred agave cocktail in a siesta form (i.e. Campari, lime, grapefruit and tequila.) Grapefruit and apples is a great pairing, hence the apple brandy and Pamplemousse Rose. The Lillet helps bind the ingredients together, and the grapefruit bitters bring out the tequila's earthy, vegetal notes.

      Did I say I really love agave? Well, here I wanted to play with tomato. I tried it with raspberry and it turned out great. The saltiness from the manzanilla really brought the flavors together. The genever added some depth and fat to the drink, and paired well with the tequila.

      This drink was inspired by the green color of wasabi. This made me think of lime and green apple, and then spiraled into absinthe and tansy. With such a green list of ingredients, it only seemed fitting to use gin. It needed some length and more depth, so the Dolin Blanc did the trick.

      I wanted to do a 50/50 Martini variation; also, I'd never really done a coconut drink without Coco López. I did an infusion, and the pisco worked really nicely.

      The grilled pineapple-infused Bols Genever we have makes for a rich, tropical and malty combination. Brown rice syrup matched the flavor profile but gave an unappealing, cloudy presentation. Genmaicha tea is a brown-rice green tea with brown rice kernels that seemed to do the trick. We steeped it and made a syrup. I'm fond of split bases for extra layers, and aged Spanish brandy balances the genever, giving beautiful dark fruit notes.

      This drink was inspired by a tiki drink I did a long time ago using Bowmore - a smoky single malt Scotch. The original turned out surprisingly tasty, and I've since made several variations. I knew that curry leaf, coconut and peat all work together, so I started there. Pineapple was added to fatten it up, but also to give it a tropical note. I added a touch of half & half to complement the Coco López and vanilla for sweetness. Then, a balance of heavily peated scotch, a milder and fruitier single malt scotch and a high-proof rum - because, well we're talking tiki, right?

      Italicus was developed by our friend Giuseppe Gallo, and as it happened, he was to be featured in this particular comic. So I wanted to come up with a drink that would be placed in the scene where he appeared. The Rosolio called out for a a refreshing spritz rather than a complex tiki-style drink. It then became a matter of matching the bergamot and floral elements with other subtle flavors including cinnamon and apple. Champagne and soda were a must - and voilà!

      Wheeler-Dealer started out as an inside joke for my old work husband. I used as many of his favorite ingredients that complemented each other as possible.This was my first cocktail to make the menu at Dead Rabbit, and it is inspired by the person who encouraged me to pursue my dreams in this industry. This is my ode to a friendship.

      Here we are with yet another take on Eidolon, itself a riff on the Army & Navy cocktail. For the fall and winter months, I wanted to embrace those flavors. I first thought to use Oloroso rather than a Manzanilla, fino or pale cream sherry as I wanted to incorporate dried fruit notes rather than bright fruit ones. Cinnamon for fall is obvious but necessary to bring the fig and pear together just right. The rest of the template is kept the same. Damn, son.

      "This drink was created to meet need on the menu for a particular type of Irish whiskey. I knew I wanted to use the Tullamore 12 Year in a drink, so I started there with a focus on fall flavors. I made a spiced pear syrup, which turned out great. That alone had enough character for a simple sour cocktail, but you know us: Why stop there? Going through pear pairings, celery and cilantro (coriander) came up. Now I just needed a lengthener and a touch more character. Nonino worked wonderfully with the spiced pear, and caramel gave it all the bump of sweetness to balance out the drink. Job done."

      There is always a place for a lighter-style Old Fashioned. Irish whiskey pairs well with tropical flavors, so the Plantation worked well. To complement this, I chose tumeric and chipotle. The honey notes of Yellow Chartreuse as another modifier and the lengthening agent of the Cocchi Americano worked well to balance the drink. Sumac gives a tangy citrusy note.

      I used to work at a restaurant that used togarashi a lot in their dishes, and it inspired me to use it in cocktails. We often get requests for spicy drinks, so I decided to start out with a daiquiri and let the sweetener be the togarashi syrup. It went from there and developed with sherry, a blend of rums and bitters.

      This cocktail was inspired by horchata - the rich Mexican beverage made from rice, almonds and sugar. I wanted something that echoed that dense texture but with more elegance. I made an horchata syrup and tried to pair it with a combination of bourbon and tequila, but it was never balanced. The answer turned out to be a blend of bourbon, Spanish brandy and cachaça. The final drink borders on the richness of a dessert cocktail, but the lime and pineapple juice create enough acidic balance to keep it refreshing.

      On a hot summer day, something sparkly and refreshing is definitely in order. Let's start with honeydew and add mint - a killer combo. Apostoles is a unique gin from Argentina with flavors of yerba mate, eucalyptus, pink grapefruit and peppermint. Martini & Rossi Bianco gives a boost of refreshing green herbs and botanicals. Perry's Tot Gin lends extra oomph with its Navy Strength Proof (57% ABV). Finally, top off with Champagne. Now, if only The Dead Rabbit had a rooftop bar...

      This is another one of those drinks inspired by spring. I know it seems a bit busy, but it just worked out that way - like a daiquiri with a lot of other interesting stuff in it. When we have drinks with a lot of elements in them, we batch up a portion of the ingredients for easy execution during service. In this case, we'll make a mix of equal parts pear syrup, apricot eau-de-vie and Sotol and pour 0.75 ounce of the mix instead of 0.25 ounce of all three separately. So you'll still have your drink in just a few minutes.

      The unlikely vodka drink strikes again. This time with another spirit you won't typically find me using, white whiskey. However, I find High West Silver Oat works well in cocktails and has some interesting notes of banana, flowers, strawberry and grapefruit. The whiskey was a bit much for a full base so I split it with Barr Hill Vodka, which is distilled from raw honey. The honey comes through, and the texture of it is rich yet clean. The drink does read a bit sweet, but adding the dry vermouth and black peppercorn fixed that.

      Yes, I did it again - another riff on Eidolon... As we're looking at spring and summer, I went for lighter and bright fruit flavors. The idea came to me when I finally found a lychee liqueur I liked. The gin simply didn't work this time with the floral components of the drink, so I tried the slightly funky Barbancourt Haitian rum. I also went for a lighter and creamier style sherry as it complemented the rhubarb, lychee and vanilla better.

      We always have a fresh-style Martini on the menu, and I wanted to make sure we did that this time as well. Also, I'd been missing our sugar snap pea tequila. Ryan made the infusion and I plugged it into that 50/50 template with falernum and celery bitters to match the snap peas. It was a bit rich and a touch flat. I bumped it up with rum. A good agricole or high-proof Wray & Nephew usually does the trick - especially in tequila-based cocktails. QED.

      I chose our Dead Rabbit Irish Whiskey for its higher proof and virgin American oak finish. It's really versatile in mixed drinks, especially shaken ones, as it doesn't get lost in the mix. I started with a simple sour of the syrups, lemon and whiskey. After tasting it, I picked two bitters that complemented the syrups well. The tiki brought a spicy, tropical high note and the decanter bound everything together. The sour was better but too sweet and too short. Sherry didn't seem like it would be acceptable, sweet vermouth too muddy, dry vermouth would clash, Bonal too bitter... Ooh, I know - Lillet Rosé. Perfecto!

      It'd been some time since I did a Martinez variation. I thought of it after tasting a new product, Glorious Gin, plus Phil Duff's new genever was on the market finally. It all came together with the martinez template. I'm not a huge fan of maraschino, so I opted for a different modifier with a split of Bonal and vanilla. Ancho chili sweet vermouth gave it a unique character, and the pineapple liqueur was the last tweak to take it to Dead Rabbit standards.

      The idea for this cocktail came from a wonderful dessert I had a long time ago at Nomad, a restaurant here in NYC. It was sort of a crumble made with pistachios, sour cherries and mascarpone cheese. That trio of flavors really stuck in my head. It took a while to figure out how to get them into a drink together. This rich whiskey sour variation was the answer.

      I was watching an Israeli documentary on cuisine - which is essentially a mishmash from all over the middle east and Mediterranean. I wanted to impart these flavors into a cocktail. Starting with a base of the whiskey sour, I swapped Greek yogurt for egg white and added a little bit of za'atar, the Middle Eastern spice blend made from sesame seeds, dried oregano and parsley and some ground sumac. A little more sumac and a clean single grain Irish whiskey was the perfect match for this drink.

      We were low on Scotch cocktails, so that was my starting point. When I'm basing a drink off a particular spirit, I do a thorough tasting, writing down all the aromas I can get. I'll use these notes to base the flavor pairing for modifiers. I thought that our genmaicha syrup would pair well with the scotch, and I knew pineapple was a great match to the brown rice as well. I then split Highland Park with calvados. Amaro Nonino is a softer style of amaro, so I picked that to add layers and complexity. Cinnamon was a nice accent to the drink.

      Every now and then, a specific product will inspire a cocktail. In this case, it was Bruto Americano - a bitter, fruit- and pine-forward aperitif. I thought it would pair well with raspberry and coffee. This turned out to be fairly difficult, and I went through many versions. In the end, I reduced the original amount of Bruto, but the end product is a herbal, dark riff on a negroni.

      I was seeking inspiration for this menu as I had a few slots to fill, so I started flipping through some of my older drinks notebooks. I have a ton of them - some organized, some definitely not. I found some dumb ideas and some really great ones. I went back to a drink called Witchdoctor I did at Death & Co, and then another at The Dead Rabbit called Rag & Bone. I morphed them together to make this drink.

      This evolved into a tiki drink, with anise-green tea-coconut-almond-lime flavor notes. Gin was picked as a base to keep it on the refreshing side. Its piña colada-style required a cream quality for body, so a touch of half & half was added. Kaffir lime leaf was shaken in to cut through the richness, giving the drink a high note and a beautiful fragrance.

    ingredients:
    - 1 TBSP Matcha Green Tea Coco López
    - 0.75OZ Lime juice

    - "Garnish: nutmeg"
    steps:
    - Build drink in tin.
    - Add kaffir lime leaf (do not muddle).
    - Whip shake with cube ice.

      Gold Digger was a stirred light Manhattan on the 3rd edition menu and a real favorite.

      This drink was inspired by Gregory's Eidolon. It was such a hit, we needed to create something within the same realm for the new menu. I kept the template of his Army & Navy riff and changed out the sweetener and the liqueur. It worked out great.

      This was flavor-drive, focused on the strawberry, rhubarb and hibiscus combination. It seemed the perfect setting for a vodka drink. Adding the bell pepper and pisco perked it up and added a floral note. It was a great way to introduce pisco to the vodka drinker as well - which was a gateway to try new drinks.

      I love fizzes but sometimes they can be too rich, so I went with coconut milk to make it healthier and a bit more delicate. Coconut makes me think of bourbon barrels, so I created this cocktail around the flavors that you would find there.

      I had a Sazerac in London that was the best I'd ever had. So I set out to make a variation I thought was even better. The Sazerac template is still the same, with the addition of the dark Jamaican rum blend and cacao.

      Virgil Kaine rye was the base inspiration. This has an intensity from its high rye mash bill and 45.5 ABV, so I had to really think about how to balance that out. The citrus, spice and notes of banana and berries made me think of the blueberry component. I now had the basic flavor profile. To modify it to be complex, I thought of Becherovka - a Czech herbal liqueur with a dominant cinnamon note. It needed to be boozier to hit the manhattan style I was after, but more rye made it too hot. I rounded it out with armagnac - yet another split base.

      Shiso is so aromatic and herbaceous that I really wanted to highlight it in a bright clean cocktail. I infused the shiso into dry vermouth and added some green tea-infused London dry gin as a base. I then added fennel and yuzu, rounding everything out with cucumber and lime juice. A dash of eucalyptus really ties everything together.

      "This Old Fashioned variation was designed around an amazing product that I bought to cook with at home: Stony Brook Butternut Squash seed oil. I wanted to use it as a fat wash in a drink, and selected single pot still Irish Whiskey as a good spirit to try, as it is complex enough to be interesting but soft enough to let the squash shine through. The rest of the ingredients were chosen to complement the butternut squash - apricot, orange, herbs and baking spice - all of which pair nicely with this squash in my kitchen."
