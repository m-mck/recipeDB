  - name: Hotel Room Temperature
    author: Kirk Estopinal
    notes: The idea for this is conceptual, though the drinks themselves are quite pleasing. The title is an homage to two song titles about the regretful aspects of love. "All's Fair" is an 'island' Manhattan and is a nod to the beginnings of love in all its fancy glory and style. Think vacations and summer vibes. The "Flip Out" should be obvious. The "Hotel Room Temperature" is representative of dishonest behavior, and so is served at room temperature. As if our hero is mixing drinks at the end of the night without his tools or ice. It's an exercise in texture and the fact that assembly can, and does, adjust the entire profile of the same ingredients.

    - 2 oz Cynar
    - 3/4 oz Punt e Mes
    - 15-21 drops of lemon juice
    - 6 dashes Regan's bitters
    - 2 pinches sea salt
    - 5 swaths of lemon peel
    steps:
    - Start with one "bakers" pinch of salt in a rocks glass. Add the Cynar and briefly stir.
    - Add the Punt e Mes, bitters, lemon juice, and ice.
    - Stir briefly to incorporate.
    - Taste, looking for only the faintest hint of salt.
    - If your drink tastes salty, throw out your first attempt and adjust the salt level.
    - When the salt level is correct, express the oil from 5 swaths of lemon peel onto the surface of the cocktail.
    - Drop one of the expressed lemon peels in alongside the side of the glass, skin side facing in.
    - An 1/8 rim of salt will allow your guest to experiment with a few salty sips.
    - This will make the following sips pleasantly sweet, and that will make your brain hurt.

    notes: Lambanog is a type of clear Philippine coconut-palm brandy. Since this is difficult to impossible to find, any white spirit that's light, clean, and floral will do, although you may have to tinker with the name of the drink. Pisco is a good place to start. To make the Jaggery syrup, melt 2 pounds of jaggery in 16 oz. water over a low flame until all is dissolved. This is easier if you hack the loaves it comes in into small pieces first. Bottle and keep refrigerated; this stuff will ferment on you.
    glassware: 
    ingredients:
    - 2 oz Queen-brand Lambanog
