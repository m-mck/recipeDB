- name: Cardamom-Coriander Syrup
  ingredients:
    - 2 cinnamon sticks, broken up
    - 1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds
    - 1 tablespoon black cardamom pods
    - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
    - 4 ounces high-proof rum
    - 15 ounces hot water
    - 3/4 cup fine granulated sugar
  steps:
    - Preheat the oven to 450°F. 
    - Spread the cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, and cardamom on a rimmed baking sheet and toast in the oven, tossing occasionally to prevent burning, until fragrant but not burned, about 8 minutes.
    - Combine the toasted spices, red pepper flakes, and rum in a blender, and blend on high speed until evenly ground, about 2 minutes.
    - Meanwhile, in a separate container, combine the hot water and sugar, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.
    - Set aside.
    - Using a coffee filter or multiple layers of cheesecloth, strain the spice and rum mixture into the sugar syrup.
    - Stir to combine.
    - Transfer to a clean, sealable bottle or container.
    - This syrup will keep, refrigerated, for 2 months.
    - Shake thoroughly before using.
    - As a substitute for the cardamom-coriander syrup, Volk recommends using 1/4 ounce St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram and 1 teaspoon of rich simple syrup (2:1, sugar:water).
- name: Teardrop's DIY Crème de Cacao
  notes: |+2
      "The crème de cacaos of the mid-19th century were meant to be consumed on their own, and despite their sweetness (their sugary viscosity, not the addition of dairy, is what earned them the “crème” moniker) balance was paramount. But as 20th-century cocktail culture swaggered in, the spotlight shifted to base spirits (whiskey, gin, etc.) and liqueurs went from stand-alone sippers to mere mixers. Thus, producers of liqueurs like crème allowed standards to wane—favoring higher levels sugar over nuance and relying on artificial coloring and oil extracts instead of actual cacao. But now, crème de cacao is seeing revival thanks to bars and bartenders making their own housemade versions that balance nuanced sweetness with the bitter beauty of chocolate. This rum-based recipe comes from Teardrop Lounge in Portland, Oregon."
  ingredients:
    - 1 3/4 cups cacao nibs
    - 1/2 cup sugar
    - 1/2 cup distilled water
    - 1 750-ml bottle Lemon Hart 151 (demerara rum)
  steps:
    - Add sugar and water to a saucepan and set over medium heat.
    - Bring to a low simmer and stir to dissolve sugar.
    - Add cacao nibs, stirring constantly. The sugar will re-granulate and smoke a bit, until it begins to slowly caramelize and coat the cacao nibs. This process should take no more than 15 minutes.
    - Remove from heat, and pour the cacao nibs onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Let cool, then break up with a spoon.
    - Reserve half of the nibs for your next batch, and place the remainder into an airtight container.
    - Top off with the rum.
    - Let steep for one week, then strain through cheesecloth.
    - Measure remaining amount and mix with equal parts distilled water to bring to proof.
    - Funnel into a bottle to serve.

- name: Moroccan Mint Tea Syrup
  notes: |+2
      
  ingredients:
    - Gunpowder green tea
    - Hot water
    - Mint sprigs and leaves
    - Sugar
  steps:
    - Add 24 grams of gunpowder green tea to a pot. Add 227 grams of hot water to the pot and swish. Strain the tea concentrate into a separate container and set aside. Add the strained tea leaves back into the pot and top off with 1 cup of hot water. Swish five times, then strain and discard the water. (The second tea infusion leeches out impurities from the opened tea buds and must be discarded or the syrup will be bitter and unpleasant.)
    - Pour the first tea concentrate back into the pot with the now-cleaned tea leaves and top off with 680 grams of hot water. Set the pot on the burner and bring to a boil on low-medium heat. Once the infusion is boiling, take it off the heat and add in 473 grams of mint sprigs and leaves; a strong mint aroma should start to permeate the air from the tea. Pour about a third of the liquid out of the pot into a separate container then pour back into the pot to fully incorporate the tea and mint flavors. Repeat three times. Do not stir.
    - Once the tea has been aerated, pour it into a container, straining out the tea leaves and mint, lightly pressing the remaining moisture out of them. Weigh the amount of tea made, discounting the container, then add an equal amount by weight of white sugar (roughly 907 grams) and stir until sugar is dissolved. Let the syrup cool and store in the refrigerator. Keeps for 3 weeks.

- name: Lime-Ginger Cordial
  notes: |+2
      
  ingredients:
    - 36 limes
    - 5 pounds white sugar
    - 2 cups fresh ginger juice (from 1.5-2 pounds ginger)
  steps:
    - Clean and peel 36 limes. Collect peels and the peeled fruit in separate large sealable containers. Cover peels with 5 lbs of white sugar. Shake and mix them until the peels are completely immersed in and mixed with the dry sugar. Leave at room temperature overnight to make oleo saccharum, a slurry of the aromatic citrus oil extracted by the sugar through capillary action.
    - Juice the peeled fruit and add juice to the oleo saccharum, stirring it with elbow grease for 5-10 minutes to break up the lumps and incorporate all. Let rest at room temperature for at least 24 hours to incorporate. Stir again to incorporate any remaining sugar and then strain off the peels through a mesh sieve. At this point you have lime cordial.
    - Next, add about 2 cups of fresh ginger juice to the mix to make lime-ginger cordial. To make fresh ginger juice at home, take 1.5-2 lbs of fresh ginger, peel and chop it into 1" pieces, and put it into a blender in batches, using the cordial to liquefy it. Let it sit with the cordial another 24 hours and then restrain it off into an airtight container and refrigerate until needed.

- name: Antica Don's Mix
  author: Garret Richard
  notes: |+2
      Garret Richard, chief cocktail officer at Brooklyn's Sunken Harbor Club, believes he's stumbled on not only a better Don's Mix, but perhaps a more period-correct version, too. Inspired by the techniques outlined by Darcy O'Neil, a chemist and drink-maker and the author of Fix the Pumps, a history of America's soda fountains, Richard applies the same flavoring techniques used at soda fountains to create what he's calling Antica Don's Mix. This means flavoring simple syrups with essences (essential oils cut with alcohol), extracts (spices rested in high-proof spirits and then strained off) and acid powders. The result is a flavor-packed product, with all the brightness of its fresh juice counterpart in a more shelf-stable package. For safety reasons, the quantity and ratio of grapefruit essence should not be adjusted.
  ingredients:
    - 1 liter 60 Brix white sugar syrup
    - 20 milliliters white grapefruit essence
    - 10 milliliters cassia extract
    - 15 grams citric acid
  steps:
    - Add the sugar syrup, grapefruit essence and cassia extract to a blender.

    - Let the syrup sit for a few hours to allow the essence and extract to coalesce in the syrup.
    - Keeps, refrigerated, for up to 2 months.

- name: Banana Peel Oleo Saccharum
  notes: |+2
      At Project Halcyon, the bar sought out ways to use peels—a byproduct from the house Martini, which features clarified banana juice—to use the whole ingredient and avoid waste. According to general manager Adam Montanaro-Taylor, the bar experimented with a host of banana peel garnishes, but in the end, what stuck was this easy-to-make banana skin “oleo.” For at-home bartending, the ingredient could replace simple syrup in a classic Daiquiri or an Old-Fashioned; adding a dash of saline solution makes the banana peel’s subtleties pop.

    - Add the coconut cream to the pot, then stir in the vanilla paste. Bring to a light boil. Simmer gently, stirring to avoid burning, until the liquid starts to reduce, not longer than 10 minutes. Remove from heat immediately, and let cool to room temperature.

- name: Orgeat
  notes: |+2
      For the Bar Agricole’s Japanese Cocktail.
  ingredients:
    - 8 ounces (227 grams) almonds
    - 1/2 ounce (14 grams) blanched apricot kernels (optional)
    - 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) water, plus more for soaking
    - About 200 grams organic evaporated cane sugar (the exact amount will vary; see directions)
    - 1/4 cup (49 milliliters) brandy, such as Bar Agricole Biodynamic California Brandy
    - 1 teaspoon orange flower water, such as Nielsen-Massey
  steps:
    - Lightly toast the almonds (and apricot kernels, if using) in the oven at 375°F for 15 minutes.
    - Place the toasted almonds in a bowl, rinse once, then cover with cold water and soak for 30 minutes.
    - Drain and discard this water. Chop the toasted nuts in a food processor until they reach a uniformly fine texture. Occasionally, stop and stir the ground nuts (aka nut meat) so the pieces on the bottom don’t turn to butter.
    - Transfer the nut meat into a large bowl and add the 1 1/2 cups of water. Let stand overnight.
    - The next day, pass the mixture through a fine-mesh chinois strainer. Save the strained liquid and nut meat in separate containers. Gently heat the liquid to 125°F (50°C). Add the nut meat back into the liquid, and let it stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
    - Pass through a chinois, and again save the liquid to reheat to 125°F (50°C).
    - Put the nut meat back into the warmed liquid for a third time, and let it stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
    - Press the nut meat through a multilayered cheesecloth (or nut milk bag) to extract as much liquid as you can.
    - Discard the solids, and weigh the nut milk. Multiply that number by 0.88 to find how much sugar to add. (You want a little less sugar than the amount of liquid. For example, if your liquid weighs 227 grams, you’ll use 200 grams of sugar.) Pour the strained liquid into a pot and add the sugar.
    - Over medium heat (180°F), stir to dissolve the sugar, then bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally until the liquid reaches the syrup stage, 230°F to 235°F. Remove from heat immediately. (Do not boil too long, otherwise the sugar will crystallize when it cools.)
    - Once the almond syrup is cooled, add the brandy and orange flower water. Store the finished orgeat in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
